["\ufeffTHUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.\n\n\n\n\nFIRST PART. ZARATHUSTRA\u2019S DISCOURSES.\n\n\n\n\nZARATHUSTRA\u2019S PROLOGUE.\n\n\n1.\n\nWhen Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of\nhis home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and\nsolitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart\nchanged,\u2014and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the\nsun, and spake thus unto it:", "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for\nwhom thou shinest!\n\nFor ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have\nwearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine\neagle, and my serpent.\n\nBut we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and\nblessed thee for it.\n\nLo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much\nhoney; I need hands outstretched to take it.", "I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become\njoyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.\n\nTherefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the\nevening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the\nnether-world, thou exuberant star!\n\nLike thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.\n\nBless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest\nhappiness without envy!", "Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden\nout of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!\n\nLo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again\ngoing to be a man.\n\nThus began Zarathustra\u2019s down-going.\n\n2.\n\nZarathustra went down the mountain alone, no one meeting him. When he\nentered the forest, however, there suddenly stood before him an old man,\nwho had left his holy cot to seek roots. And thus spake the old man to\nZarathustra:", "\u201cNo stranger to me is this wanderer: many years ago passed he by.\nZarathustra he was called; but he hath altered.\n\nThen thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains: wilt thou now carry\nthy fire into the valleys? Fearest thou not the incendiary\u2019s doom?\n\nYea, I recognise Zarathustra. Pure is his eye, and no loathing lurketh\nabout his mouth. Goeth he not along like a dancer?", "Altered is Zarathustra; a child hath Zarathustra become; an awakened one\nis Zarathustra: what wilt thou do in the land of the sleepers?\n\nAs in the sea hast thou lived in solitude, and it hath borne thee up.\nAlas, wilt thou now go ashore? Alas, wilt thou again drag thy body\nthyself?\u201d\n\nZarathustra answered: \u201cI love mankind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said the saint, \u201cdid I go into the forest and the desert? Was it\nnot because I loved men far too well?", "Now I love God: men, I do not love. Man is a thing too imperfect for me.\nLove to man would be fatal to me.\u201d\n\nZarathustra answered: \u201cWhat spake I of love! I am bringing gifts unto\nmen.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive them nothing,\u201d said the saint. \u201cTake rather part of their load,\nand carry it along with them\u2014that will be most agreeable unto them: if\nonly it be agreeable unto thee!\n\nIf, however, thou wilt give unto them, give them no more than an alms,\nand let them also beg for it!\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d replied Zarathustra, \u201cI give no alms. I am not poor enough for\nthat.\u201d\n\nThe saint laughed at Zarathustra, and spake thus: \u201cThen see to it that\nthey accept thy treasures! They are distrustful of anchorites, and do\nnot believe that we come with gifts.\n\nThe fall of our footsteps ringeth too hollow through their streets. And\njust as at night, when they are in bed and hear a man abroad long before\nsunrise, so they ask themselves concerning us: Where goeth the thief?", "Go not to men, but stay in the forest! Go rather to the animals! Why not\nbe like me\u2014a bear amongst bears, a bird amongst birds?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what doeth the saint in the forest?\u201d asked Zarathustra.\n\nThe saint answered: \u201cI make hymns and sing them; and in making hymns I\nlaugh and weep and mumble: thus do I praise God.\n\nWith singing, weeping, laughing, and mumbling do I praise the God who is\nmy God. But what dost thou bring us as a gift?\u201d", "When Zarathustra had heard these words, he bowed to the saint and said:\n\u201cWhat should I have to give thee! Let me rather hurry hence lest I take\naught away from thee!\u201d\u2014And thus they parted from one another, the old\nman and Zarathustra, laughing like schoolboys.\n\nWhen Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: \u201cCould it be\npossible! This old saint in the forest hath not yet heard of it, that\nGOD IS DEAD!\u201d\n\n3.", "3.\n\nWhen Zarathustra arrived at the nearest town which adjoineth the forest,\nhe found many people assembled in the market-place; for it had been\nannounced that a rope-dancer would give a performance. And Zarathustra\nspake thus unto the people:\n\nI TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN. Man is something that is to be surpassed. What\nhave ye done to surpass man?", "All beings hitherto have created something beyond themselves: and ye\nwant to be the ebb of that great tide, and would rather go back to the\nbeast than surpass man?\n\nWhat is the ape to man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And just the\nsame shall man be to the Superman: a laughing-stock, a thing of shame.\n\nYe have made your way from the worm to man, and much within you is still\nworm. Once were ye apes, and even yet man is more of an ape than any of\nthe apes.", "Even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid of plant and\nphantom. But do I bid you become phantoms or plants?\n\nLo, I teach you the Superman!\n\nThe Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The\nSuperman SHALL BE the meaning of the earth!\n\nI conjure you, my brethren, REMAIN TRUE TO THE EARTH, and believe not\nthose who speak unto you of superearthly hopes! Poisoners are they,\nwhether they know it or not.", "Despisers of life are they, decaying ones and poisoned ones themselves,\nof whom the earth is weary: so away with them!\n\nOnce blasphemy against God was the greatest blasphemy; but God died,\nand therewith also those blasphemers. To blaspheme the earth is now the\ndreadfulest sin, and to rate the heart of the unknowable higher than the\nmeaning of the earth!", "Once the soul looked contemptuously on the body, and then that contempt\nwas the supreme thing:\u2014the soul wished the body meagre, ghastly, and\nfamished. Thus it thought to escape from the body and the earth.\n\nOh, that soul was itself meagre, ghastly, and famished; and cruelty was\nthe delight of that soul!\n\nBut ye, also, my brethren, tell me: What doth your body say about\nyour soul? Is your soul not poverty and pollution and wretched\nself-complacency?", "Verily, a polluted stream is man. One must be a sea, to receive a\npolluted stream without becoming impure.\n\nLo, I teach you the Superman: he is that sea; in him can your great\ncontempt be submerged.\n\nWhat is the greatest thing ye can experience? It is the hour of great\ncontempt. The hour in which even your happiness becometh loathsome unto\nyou, and so also your reason and virtue.", "The hour when ye say: \u201cWhat good is my happiness! It is poverty and\npollution and wretched self-complacency. But my happiness should justify\nexistence itself!\u201d\n\nThe hour when ye say: \u201cWhat good is my reason! Doth it long for\nknowledge as the lion for his food? It is poverty and pollution and\nwretched self-complacency!\u201d", "The hour when ye say: \u201cWhat good is my virtue! As yet it hath not made\nme passionate. How weary I am of my good and my bad! It is all poverty\nand pollution and wretched self-complacency!\u201d\n\nThe hour when ye say: \u201cWhat good is my justice! I do not see that I am\nfervour and fuel. The just, however, are fervour and fuel!\u201d\n\nThe hour when ye say: \u201cWhat good is my pity! Is not pity the cross on\nwhich he is nailed who loveth man? But my pity is not a crucifixion.\u201d", "Have ye ever spoken thus? Have ye ever cried thus? Ah! would that I had\nheard you crying thus!\n\nIt is not your sin\u2014it is your self-satisfaction that crieth unto\nheaven; your very sparingness in sin crieth unto heaven!\n\nWhere is the lightning to lick you with its tongue? Where is the frenzy\nwith which ye should be inoculated?\n\nLo, I teach you the Superman: he is that lightning, he is that frenzy!\u2014", "When Zarathustra had thus spoken, one of the people called out: \u201cWe have\nnow heard enough of the rope-dancer; it is time now for us to see him!\u201d\n And all the people laughed at Zarathustra. But the rope-dancer, who\nthought the words applied to him, began his performance.\n\n4.\n\nZarathustra, however, looked at the people and wondered. Then he spake\nthus:\n\nMan is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman\u2014a rope over\nan abyss.", "A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a\ndangerous trembling and halting.\n\nWhat is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what is\nlovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.\n\nI love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they\nare the over-goers.\n\nI love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, and\narrows of longing for the other shore.", "I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going\ndown and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that\nthe earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive.\n\nI love him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in\norder that the Superman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he his own\ndown-going.", "I love him who laboureth and inventeth, that he may build the house for\nthe Superman, and prepare for him earth, animal, and plant: for thus\nseeketh he his own down-going.\n\nI love him who loveth his virtue: for virtue is the will to down-going,\nand an arrow of longing.\n\nI love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself, but wanteth to\nbe wholly the spirit of his virtue: thus walketh he as spirit over the\nbridge.", "I love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and destiny: thus, for\nthe sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more.\n\nI love him who desireth not too many virtues. One virtue is more of a\nvirtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one\u2019s destiny to cling\nto.\n\nI love him whose soul is lavish, who wanteth no thanks and doth not give\nback: for he always bestoweth, and desireth not to keep for himself.", "I love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favour, and who then\nasketh: \u201cAm I a dishonest player?\u201d\u2014for he is willing to succumb.\n\nI love him who scattereth golden words in advance of his deeds, and\nalways doeth more than he promiseth: for he seeketh his own down-going.\n\nI love him who justifieth the future ones, and redeemeth the past ones:\nfor he is willing to succumb through the present ones.", "I love him who chasteneth his God, because he loveth his God: for he\nmust succumb through the wrath of his God.\n\nI love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and may succumb\nthrough a small matter: thus goeth he willingly over the bridge.\n\nI love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgetteth himself, and all\nthings are in him: thus all things become his down-going.", "I love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart: thus is his\nhead only the bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causeth his\ndown-going.\n\nI love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark\ncloud that lowereth over man: they herald the coming of the lightning,\nand succumb as heralds.\n\nLo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of the cloud:\nthe lightning, however, is the SUPERMAN.\u2014\n\n5.", "5.\n\nWhen Zarathustra had spoken these words, he again looked at the people,\nand was silent. \u201cThere they stand,\u201d said he to his heart; \u201cthere they\nlaugh: they understand me not; I am not the mouth for these ears.\n\nMust one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear with their\neyes? Must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers? Or do\nthey only believe the stammerer?", "They have something whereof they are proud. What do they call it, that\nwhich maketh them proud? Culture, they call it; it distinguisheth them\nfrom the goatherds.\n\nThey dislike, therefore, to hear of \u2018contempt\u2019 of themselves. So I will\nappeal to their pride.\n\nI will speak unto them of the most contemptible thing: that, however, is\nTHE LAST MAN!\u201d\n\nAnd thus spake Zarathustra unto the people:\n\nIt is time for man to fix his goal. It is time for man to plant the germ\nof his highest hope.", "Still is his soil rich enough for it. But that soil will one day be\npoor and exhausted, and no lofty tree will any longer be able to grow\nthereon.\n\nAlas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of\nhis longing beyond man\u2014and the string of his bow will have unlearned to\nwhizz!\n\nI tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing\nstar. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.", "Alas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any\nstar. Alas! There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no\nlonger despise himself.\n\nLo! I show you THE LAST MAN.\n\n\u201cWhat is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?\u201d\u2014so\nasketh the last man and blinketh.\n\nThe earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth the last man\nwho maketh everything small. His species is ineradicable like that of\nthe ground-flea; the last man liveth longest.", "\u201cWe have discovered happiness\u201d\u2014say the last men, and blink thereby.\n\nThey have left the regions where it is hard to live; for they need\nwarmth. One still loveth one\u2019s neighbour and rubbeth against him; for\none needeth warmth.\n\nTurning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they walk\nwarily. He is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or men!\n\nA little poison now and then: that maketh pleasant dreams. And much\npoison at last for a pleasant death.", "One still worketh, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the\npastime should hurt one.\n\nOne no longer becometh poor or rich; both are too burdensome. Who still\nwanteth to rule? Who still wanteth to obey? Both are too burdensome.\n\nNo shepherd, and one herd! Every one wanteth the same; every one is\nequal: he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse.\n\n\u201cFormerly all the world was insane,\u201d\u2014say the subtlest of them, and\nblink thereby.", "They are clever and know all that hath happened: so there is\nno end to their raillery. People still fall out, but are soon\nreconciled\u2014otherwise it spoileth their stomachs.\n\nThey have their little pleasures for the day, and their little pleasures\nfor the night, but they have a regard for health.\n\n\u201cWe have discovered happiness,\u201d\u2014say the last men, and blink thereby.\u2014", "And here ended the first discourse of Zarathustra, which is also\ncalled \u201cThe Prologue\u201d: for at this point the shouting and mirth of the\nmultitude interrupted him. \u201cGive us this last man, O Zarathustra,\u201d\u2014they\ncalled out\u2014\u201cmake us into these last men! Then will we make thee a\npresent of the Superman!\u201d And all the people exulted and smacked their\nlips. Zarathustra, however, turned sad, and said to his heart:\n\n\u201cThey understand me not: I am not the mouth for these ears.", "Too long, perhaps, have I lived in the mountains; too much have I\nhearkened unto the brooks and trees: now do I speak unto them as unto\nthe goatherds.\n\nCalm is my soul, and clear, like the mountains in the morning. But they\nthink me cold, and a mocker with terrible jests.\n\nAnd now do they look at me and laugh: and while they laugh they hate me\ntoo. There is ice in their laughter.\u201d\n\n6.", "Then, however, something happened which made every mouth mute and every\neye fixed. In the meantime, of course, the rope-dancer had commenced his\nperformance: he had come out at a little door, and was going along the\nrope which was stretched between two towers, so that it hung above the\nmarket-place and the people. When he was just midway across, the little\ndoor opened once more, and a gaudily-dressed fellow like a buffoon\nsprang out, and went rapidly after the first one. \u201cGo on, halt-foot,\u201d", "cried his frightful voice, \u201cgo on, lazy-bones, interloper,\nsallow-face!\u2014lest I tickle thee with my heel! What dost thou here\nbetween the towers? In the tower is the place for thee, thou shouldst be\nlocked up; to one better than thyself thou blockest the way!\u201d\u2014And with\nevery word he came nearer and nearer the first one. When, however, he\nwas but a step behind, there happened the frightful thing which made\nevery mouth mute and every eye fixed\u2014he uttered a yell like a devil,", "and jumped over the other who was in his way. The latter, however, when\nhe thus saw his rival triumph, lost at the same time his head and his\nfooting on the rope; he threw his pole away, and shot downwards faster\nthan it, like an eddy of arms and legs, into the depth. The market-place\nand the people were like the sea when the storm cometh on: they all flew\napart and in disorder, especially where the body was about to fall.", "Zarathustra, however, remained standing, and just beside him fell the\nbody, badly injured and disfigured, but not yet dead. After a while\nconsciousness returned to the shattered man, and he saw Zarathustra\nkneeling beside him. \u201cWhat art thou doing there?\u201d said he at last, \u201cI\nknew long ago that the devil would trip me up. Now he draggeth me to\nhell: wilt thou prevent him?\u201d", "\u201cOn mine honour, my friend,\u201d answered Zarathustra, \u201cthere is nothing of\nall that whereof thou speakest: there is no devil and no hell. Thy soul\nwill be dead even sooner than thy body: fear, therefore, nothing any\nmore!\u201d\n\nThe man looked up distrustfully. \u201cIf thou speakest the truth,\u201d said he,\n\u201cI lose nothing when I lose my life. I am not much more than an animal\nwhich hath been taught to dance by blows and scanty fare.\u201d", "\u201cNot at all,\u201d said Zarathustra, \u201cthou hast made danger thy calling;\ntherein there is nothing contemptible. Now thou perishest by thy\ncalling: therefore will I bury thee with mine own hands.\u201d\n\nWhen Zarathustra had said this the dying one did not reply further; but\nhe moved his hand as if he sought the hand of Zarathustra in gratitude.\n\n7.", "7.\n\nMeanwhile the evening came on, and the market-place veiled itself in\ngloom. Then the people dispersed, for even curiosity and terror become\nfatigued. Zarathustra, however, still sat beside the dead man on the\nground, absorbed in thought: so he forgot the time. But at last it\nbecame night, and a cold wind blew upon the lonely one. Then arose\nZarathustra and said to his heart:\n\nVerily, a fine catch of fish hath Zarathustra made to-day! It is not a\nman he hath caught, but a corpse.", "Sombre is human life, and as yet without meaning: a buffoon may be\nfateful to it.\n\nI want to teach men the sense of their existence, which is the Superman,\nthe lightning out of the dark cloud\u2014man.\n\nBut still am I far from them, and my sense speaketh not unto their\nsense. To men I am still something between a fool and a corpse.\n\nGloomy is the night, gloomy are the ways of Zarathustra. Come, thou cold\nand stiff companion! I carry thee to the place where I shall bury thee\nwith mine own hands.\n\n8.", "When Zarathustra had said this to his heart, he put the corpse upon his\nshoulders and set out on his way. Yet had he not gone a hundred steps,\nwhen there stole a man up to him and whispered in his ear\u2014and lo!\nhe that spake was the buffoon from the tower. \u201cLeave this town, O\nZarathustra,\u201d said he, \u201cthere are too many here who hate thee. The\ngood and just hate thee, and call thee their enemy and despiser; the\nbelievers in the orthodox belief hate thee, and call thee a danger to", "the multitude. It was thy good fortune to be laughed at: and verily thou\nspakest like a buffoon. It was thy good fortune to associate with the\ndead dog; by so humiliating thyself thou hast saved thy life to-day.\nDepart, however, from this town,\u2014or to-morrow I shall jump over thee,\na living man over a dead one.\u201d And when he had said this, the buffoon\nvanished; Zarathustra, however, went on through the dark streets.", "At the gate of the town the grave-diggers met him: they shone their\ntorch on his face, and, recognising Zarathustra, they sorely derided\nhim. \u201cZarathustra is carrying away the dead dog: a fine thing that\nZarathustra hath turned a grave-digger! For our hands are too cleanly\nfor that roast. Will Zarathustra steal the bite from the devil? Well\nthen, good luck to the repast! If only the devil is not a better thief\nthan Zarathustra!\u2014he will steal them both, he will eat them both!\u201d And", "they laughed among themselves, and put their heads together.", "Zarathustra made no answer thereto, but went on his way. When he had\ngone on for two hours, past forests and swamps, he had heard too much of\nthe hungry howling of the wolves, and he himself became a-hungry. So he\nhalted at a lonely house in which a light was burning.\n\n\u201cHunger attacketh me,\u201d said Zarathustra, \u201clike a robber. Among forests\nand swamps my hunger attacketh me, and late in the night.", "\u201cStrange humours hath my hunger. Often it cometh to me only after a\nrepast, and all day it hath failed to come: where hath it been?\u201d\n\nAnd thereupon Zarathustra knocked at the door of the house. An old man\nappeared, who carried a light, and asked: \u201cWho cometh unto me and my bad\nsleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cA living man and a dead one,\u201d said Zarathustra. \u201cGive me something to\neat and drink, I forgot it during the day. He that feedeth the hungry\nrefresheth his own soul, saith wisdom.\u201d", "The old man withdrew, but came back immediately and offered Zarathustra\nbread and wine. \u201cA bad country for the hungry,\u201d said he; \u201cthat is why\nI live here. Animal and man come unto me, the anchorite. But bid thy\ncompanion eat and drink also, he is wearier than thou.\u201d Zarathustra\nanswered: \u201cMy companion is dead; I shall hardly be able to persuade him\nto eat.\u201d \u201cThat doth not concern me,\u201d said the old man sullenly; \u201che\nthat knocketh at my door must take what I offer him. Eat, and fare ye\nwell!\u201d\u2014", "Thereafter Zarathustra again went on for two hours, trusting to the path\nand the light of the stars: for he was an experienced night-walker, and\nliked to look into the face of all that slept. When the morning dawned,\nhowever, Zarathustra found himself in a thick forest, and no path was\nany longer visible. He then put the dead man in a hollow tree at his\nhead\u2014for he wanted to protect him from the wolves\u2014and laid himself\ndown on the ground and moss. And immediately he fell asleep, tired in", "body, but with a tranquil soul.", "9.\n\nLong slept Zarathustra; and not only the rosy dawn passed over his head,\nbut also the morning. At last, however, his eyes opened, and amazedly he\ngazed into the forest and the stillness, amazedly he gazed into himself.\nThen he arose quickly, like a seafarer who all at once seeth the land;\nand he shouted for joy: for he saw a new truth. And he spake thus to his\nheart:", "A light hath dawned upon me: I need companions\u2014living ones; not dead\ncompanions and corpses, which I carry with me where I will.\n\nBut I need living companions, who will follow me because they want to\nfollow themselves\u2014and to the place where I will.\n\nA light hath dawned upon me. Not to the people is Zarathustra to speak,\nbut to companions! Zarathustra shall not be the herd\u2019s herdsman and\nhound!", "To allure many from the herd\u2014for that purpose have I come. The people\nand the herd must be angry with me: a robber shall Zarathustra be called\nby the herdsmen.\n\nHerdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the good and just. Herdsmen, I\nsay, but they call themselves the believers in the orthodox belief.\n\nBehold the good and just! Whom do they hate most? Him who breaketh up\ntheir tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker:\u2014he, however, is\nthe creator.", "Behold the believers of all beliefs! Whom do they hate most? Him who\nbreaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker\u2014he,\nhowever, is the creator.\n\nCompanions, the creator seeketh, not corpses\u2014and not herds or believers\neither. Fellow-creators the creator seeketh\u2014those who grave new values\non new tables.", "Companions, the creator seeketh, and fellow-reapers: for everything is\nripe for the harvest with him. But he lacketh the hundred sickles: so he\nplucketh the ears of corn and is vexed.\n\nCompanions, the creator seeketh, and such as know how to whet their\nsickles. Destroyers, will they be called, and despisers of good and\nevil. But they are the reapers and rejoicers.", "Fellow-creators, Zarathustra seeketh; fellow-reapers and\nfellow-rejoicers, Zarathustra seeketh: what hath he to do with herds and\nherdsmen and corpses!\n\nAnd thou, my first companion, rest in peace! Well have I buried thee in\nthy hollow tree; well have I hid thee from the wolves.\n\nBut I part from thee; the time hath arrived. \u2018Twixt rosy dawn and rosy\ndawn there came unto me a new truth.", "I am not to be a herdsman, I am not to be a grave-digger. Not any more\nwill I discourse unto the people; for the last time have I spoken unto\nthe dead.\n\nWith the creators, the reapers, and the rejoicers will I associate: the\nrainbow will I show them, and all the stairs to the Superman.\n\nTo the lone-dwellers will I sing my song, and to the twain-dwellers;\nand unto him who hath still ears for the unheard, will I make the heart\nheavy with my happiness.", "I make for my goal, I follow my course; over the loitering and tardy\nwill I leap. Thus let my on-going be their down-going!\n\n10.\n\nThis had Zarathustra said to his heart when the sun stood at noontide.\nThen he looked inquiringly aloft,\u2014for he heard above him the sharp call\nof a bird. And behold! An eagle swept through the air in wide circles,\nand on it hung a serpent, not like a prey, but like a friend: for it\nkept itself coiled round the eagle\u2019s neck.", "\u201cThey are mine animals,\u201d said Zarathustra, and rejoiced in his heart.\n\n\u201cThe proudest animal under the sun, and the wisest animal under the\nsun,\u2014they have come out to reconnoitre.\n\nThey want to know whether Zarathustra still liveth. Verily, do I still\nlive?\n\nMore dangerous have I found it among men than among animals; in\ndangerous paths goeth Zarathustra. Let mine animals lead me!\u201d", "When Zarathustra had said this, he remembered the words of the saint in\nthe forest. Then he sighed and spake thus to his heart:\n\n\u201cWould that I were wiser! Would that I were wise from the very heart,\nlike my serpent!\n\nBut I am asking the impossible. Therefore do I ask my pride to go always\nwith my wisdom!\n\nAnd if my wisdom should some day forsake me:\u2014alas! it loveth to fly\naway!\u2014may my pride then fly with my folly!\u201d\n\nThus began Zarathustra\u2019s down-going.\n\n\n\n\nZARATHUSTRA\u2019S DISCOURSES.", "ZARATHUSTRA\u2019S DISCOURSES.\n\n\n\n\nI. THE THREE METAMORPHOSES.\n\n\nThree metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit\nbecometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.\n\nMany heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing\nspirit in which reverence dwelleth: for the heavy and the heaviest\nlongeth its strength.\n\nWhat is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it down\nlike the camel, and wanteth to be well laden.", "What is the heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bearing spirit,\nthat I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.\n\nIs it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one\u2019s pride? To\nexhibit one\u2019s folly in order to mock at one\u2019s wisdom?\n\nOr is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its triumph? To\nascend high mountains to tempt the tempter?\n\nOr is it this: To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, and for the\nsake of truth to suffer hunger of soul?", "Or is it this: To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make friends of\nthe deaf, who never hear thy requests?\n\nOr is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and\nnot disclaim cold frogs and hot toads?\n\nOr is it this: To love those who despise us, and give one\u2019s hand to the\nphantom when it is going to frighten us?", "All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself:\nand like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into the wilderness, so\nhasteneth the spirit into its wilderness.\n\nBut in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis: here\nthe spirit becometh a lion; freedom will it capture, and lordship in its\nown wilderness.\n\nIts last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to its\nlast God; for victory will it struggle with the great dragon.", "What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to call\nLord and God? \u201cThou shalt,\u201d is the great dragon called. But the spirit\nof the lion saith, \u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cThou shalt,\u201d lieth in its path, sparkling with gold\u2014a scale-covered\nbeast; and on every scale glittereth golden, \u201cThou shalt!\u201d\n\nThe values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and\nthus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: \u201cAll the values of\nthings\u2014glitter on me.", "All values have already been created, and all created values\u2014do I\nrepresent. Verily, there shall be no \u2018I will\u2019 any more.\u201d Thus speaketh\nthe dragon.\n\nMy brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit? Why\nsufficeth not the beast of burden, which renounceth and is reverent?\n\nTo create new values\u2014that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to\ncreate itself freedom for new creating\u2014that can the might of the lion\ndo.", "To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty: for that,\nmy brethren, there is need of the lion.\n\nTo assume the right to new values\u2014that is the most formidable\nassumption for a load-bearing and reverent spirit. Verily, unto such a\nspirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey.", "As its holiest, it once loved \u201cThou shalt\u201d: now is it forced to find\nillusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest things, that it may\ncapture freedom from its love: the lion is needed for this capture.\n\nBut tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the lion\ncould not do? Why hath the preying lion still to become a child?\n\nInnocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a\nself-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea.", "Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea\nunto life: ITS OWN will, willeth now the spirit; HIS OWN world winneth\nthe world\u2019s outcast.\n\nThree metamorphoses of the spirit have I designated to you: how the\nspirit became a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra. And at that time he abode in the town which is\ncalled The Pied Cow.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE.", "II. THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE.\n\n\nPeople commended unto Zarathustra a wise man, as one who could discourse\nwell about sleep and virtue: greatly was he honoured and rewarded for\nit, and all the youths sat before his chair. To him went Zarathustra,\nand sat among the youths before his chair. And thus spake the wise man:\n\nRespect and modesty in presence of sleep! That is the first thing! And\nto go out of the way of all who sleep badly and keep awake at night!", "Modest is even the thief in presence of sleep: he always stealeth softly\nthrough the night. Immodest, however, is the night-watchman; immodestly\nhe carrieth his horn.\n\nNo small art is it to sleep: it is necessary for that purpose to keep\nawake all day.\n\nTen times a day must thou overcome thyself: that causeth wholesome\nweariness, and is poppy to the soul.\n\nTen times must thou reconcile again with thyself; for overcoming is\nbitterness, and badly sleep the unreconciled.", "Ten truths must thou find during the day; otherwise wilt thou seek truth\nduring the night, and thy soul will have been hungry.\n\nTen times must thou laugh during the day, and be cheerful; otherwise thy\nstomach, the father of affliction, will disturb thee in the night.\n\nFew people know it, but one must have all the virtues in order to sleep\nwell. Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit adultery?\n\nShall I covet my neighbour\u2019s maidservant? All that would ill accord with\ngood sleep.", "And even if one have all the virtues, there is still one thing needful:\nto send the virtues themselves to sleep at the right time.\n\nThat they may not quarrel with one another, the good females! And about\nthee, thou unhappy one!\n\nPeace with God and thy neighbour: so desireth good sleep. And peace also\nwith thy neighbour\u2019s devil! Otherwise it will haunt thee in the night.", "Honour to the government, and obedience, and also to the crooked\ngovernment! So desireth good sleep. How can I help it, if power like to\nwalk on crooked legs?\n\nHe who leadeth his sheep to the greenest pasture, shall always be for me\nthe best shepherd: so doth it accord with good sleep.\n\nMany honours I want not, nor great treasures: they excite the spleen.\nBut it is bad sleeping without a good name and a little treasure.", "A small company is more welcome to me than a bad one: but they must come\nand go at the right time. So doth it accord with good sleep.\n\nWell, also, do the poor in spirit please me: they promote sleep. Blessed\nare they, especially if one always give in to them.\n\nThus passeth the day unto the virtuous. When night cometh, then take I\ngood care not to summon sleep. It disliketh to be summoned\u2014sleep, the\nlord of the virtues!", "But I think of what I have done and thought during the day. Thus\nruminating, patient as a cow, I ask myself: What were thy ten\novercomings?\n\nAnd what were the ten reconciliations, and the ten truths, and the ten\nlaughters with which my heart enjoyed itself?\n\nThus pondering, and cradled by forty thoughts, it overtaketh me all at\nonce\u2014sleep, the unsummoned, the lord of the virtues.\n\nSleep tappeth on mine eye, and it turneth heavy. Sleep toucheth my\nmouth, and it remaineth open.", "Verily, on soft soles doth it come to me, the dearest of thieves, and\nstealeth from me my thoughts: stupid do I then stand, like this academic\nchair.\n\nBut not much longer do I then stand: I already lie.\u2014\n\nWhen Zarathustra heard the wise man thus speak, he laughed in his heart:\nfor thereby had a light dawned upon him. And thus spake he to his heart:\n\nA fool seemeth this wise man with his forty thoughts: but I believe he\nknoweth well how to sleep.", "Happy even is he who liveth near this wise man! Such sleep is\ncontagious\u2014even through a thick wall it is contagious.\n\nA magic resideth even in his academic chair. And not in vain did the\nyouths sit before the preacher of virtue.\n\nHis wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well. And verily, if\nlife had no sense, and had I to choose nonsense, this would be the\ndesirablest nonsense for me also.", "Now know I well what people sought formerly above all else when they\nsought teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought for themselves, and\npoppy-head virtues to promote it!\n\nTo all those belauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom was sleep\nwithout dreams: they knew no higher significance of life.\n\nEven at present, to be sure, there are some like this preacher of\nvirtue, and not always so honourable: but their time is past. And not\nmuch longer do they stand: there they already lie.", "Blessed are those drowsy ones: for they shall soon nod to sleep.\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nIII. BACKWORLDSMEN.\n\n\nOnce on a time, Zarathustra also cast his fancy beyond man, like all\nbackworldsmen. The work of a suffering and tortured God, did the world\nthen seem to me.\n\nThe dream\u2014and diction\u2014of a God, did the world then seem to me;\ncoloured vapours before the eyes of a divinely dissatisfied one.", "Good and evil, and joy and woe, and I and thou\u2014coloured vapours did\nthey seem to me before creative eyes. The creator wished to look away\nfrom himself,\u2014thereupon he created the world.\n\nIntoxicating joy is it for the sufferer to look away from his suffering\nand forget himself. Intoxicating joy and self-forgetting, did the world\nonce seem to me.", "This world, the eternally imperfect, an eternal contradiction\u2019s image\nand imperfect image\u2014an intoxicating joy to its imperfect creator:\u2014thus\ndid the world once seem to me.\n\nThus, once on a time, did I also cast my fancy beyond man, like all\nbackworldsmen. Beyond man, forsooth?\n\nAh, ye brethren, that God whom I created was human work and human\nmadness, like all the Gods!", "A man was he, and only a poor fragment of a man and ego. Out of mine own\nashes and glow it came unto me, that phantom. And verily, it came not\nunto me from the beyond!\n\nWhat happened, my brethren? I surpassed myself, the suffering one; I\ncarried mine own ashes to the mountain; a brighter flame I contrived for\nmyself. And lo! Thereupon the phantom WITHDREW from me!", "To me the convalescent would it now be suffering and torment to believe\nin such phantoms: suffering would it now be to me, and humiliation. Thus\nspeak I to backworldsmen.\n\nSuffering was it, and impotence\u2014that created all backworlds; and\nthe short madness of happiness, which only the greatest sufferer\nexperienceth.\n\nWeariness, which seeketh to get to the ultimate with one leap, with\na death-leap; a poor ignorant weariness, unwilling even to will any\nlonger: that created all Gods and backworlds.", "Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the body\u2014it\ngroped with the fingers of the infatuated spirit at the ultimate walls.\n\nBelieve me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the\nearth\u2014it heard the bowels of existence speaking unto it.\n\nAnd then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its head\u2014and\nnot with its head only\u2014into \u201cthe other world.\u201d", "But that \u201cother world\u201d is well concealed from man, that dehumanised,\ninhuman world, which is a celestial naught; and the bowels of existence\ndo not speak unto man, except as man.\n\nVerily, it is difficult to prove all being, and hard to make it speak.\nTell me, ye brethren, is not the strangest of all things best proved?\n\nYea, this ego, with its contradiction and perplexity, speaketh most\nuprightly of its being\u2014this creating, willing, evaluing ego, which is\nthe measure and value of things.", "And this most upright existence, the ego\u2014it speaketh of the body, and\nstill implieth the body, even when it museth and raveth and fluttereth\nwith broken wings.\n\nAlways more uprightly learneth it to speak, the ego; and the more it\nlearneth, the more doth it find titles and honours for the body and the\nearth.", "A new pride taught me mine ego, and that teach I unto men: no longer\nto thrust one\u2019s head into the sand of celestial things, but to carry it\nfreely, a terrestrial head, which giveth meaning to the earth!\n\nA new will teach I unto men: to choose that path which man hath followed\nblindly, and to approve of it\u2014and no longer to slink aside from it,\nlike the sick and perishing!", "The sick and perishing\u2014it was they who despised the body and the earth,\nand invented the heavenly world, and the redeeming blood-drops; but even\nthose sweet and sad poisons they borrowed from the body and the earth!\n\nFrom their misery they sought escape, and the stars were too remote for\nthem. Then they sighed: \u201cO that there were heavenly paths by which to\nsteal into another existence and into happiness!\u201d Then they contrived\nfor themselves their by-paths and bloody draughts!", "Beyond the sphere of their body and this earth they now fancied\nthemselves transported, these ungrateful ones. But to what did they owe\nthe convulsion and rapture of their transport? To their body and this\nearth.\n\nGentle is Zarathustra to the sickly. Verily, he is not indignant\nat their modes of consolation and ingratitude. May they become\nconvalescents and overcomers, and create higher bodies for themselves!", "Neither is Zarathustra indignant at a convalescent who looketh tenderly\non his delusions, and at midnight stealeth round the grave of his God;\nbut sickness and a sick frame remain even in his tears.\n\nMany sickly ones have there always been among those who muse, and\nlanguish for God; violently they hate the discerning ones, and the\nlatest of virtues, which is uprightness.", "Backward they always gaze toward dark ages: then, indeed, were delusion\nand faith something different. Raving of the reason was likeness to God,\nand doubt was sin.\n\nToo well do I know those godlike ones: they insist on being believed in,\nand that doubt is sin. Too well, also, do I know what they themselves\nmost believe in.\n\nVerily, not in backworlds and redeeming blood-drops: but in the body\ndo they also believe most; and their own body is for them the\nthing-in-itself.", "But it is a sickly thing to them, and gladly would they get out of their\nskin. Therefore hearken they to the preachers of death, and themselves\npreach backworlds.\n\nHearken rather, my brethren, to the voice of the healthy body; it is a\nmore upright and pure voice.\n\nMore uprightly and purely speaketh the healthy body, perfect and\nsquare-built; and it speaketh of the meaning of the earth.\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nIV. THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY.", "IV. THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY.\n\n\nTo the despisers of the body will I speak my word. I wish them neither\nto learn afresh, nor teach anew, but only to bid farewell to their own\nbodies,\u2014and thus be dumb.\n\n\u201cBody am I, and soul\u201d\u2014so saith the child. And why should one not speak\nlike children?\n\nBut the awakened one, the knowing one, saith: \u201cBody am I entirely, and\nnothing more; and soul is only the name of something in the body.\u201d", "The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a\npeace, a flock and a shepherd.\n\nAn instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother, which\nthou callest \u201cspirit\u201d\u2014a little instrument and plaything of thy big\nsagacity.\n\n\u201cEgo,\u201d sayest thou, and art proud of that word. But the greater\nthing\u2014in which thou art unwilling to believe\u2014is thy body with its big\nsagacity; it saith not \u201cego,\u201d but doeth it.", "What the sense feeleth, what the spirit discerneth, hath never its end\nin itself. But sense and spirit would fain persuade thee that they are\nthe end of all things: so vain are they.\n\nInstruments and playthings are sense and spirit: behind them there\nis still the Self. The Self seeketh with the eyes of the senses, it\nhearkeneth also with the ears of the spirit.\n\nEver hearkeneth the Self, and seeketh; it compareth, mastereth,\nconquereth, and destroyeth. It ruleth, and is also the ego\u2019s ruler.", "Behind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord,\nan unknown sage\u2014it is called Self; it dwelleth in thy body, it is thy\nbody.\n\nThere is more sagacity in thy body than in thy best wisdom. And who then\nknoweth why thy body requireth just thy best wisdom?", "Thy Self laugheth at thine ego, and its proud prancings. \u201cWhat are these\nprancings and flights of thought unto me?\u201d it saith to itself. \u201cA by-way\nto my purpose. I am the leading-string of the ego, and the prompter of\nits notions.\u201d\n\nThe Self saith unto the ego: \u201cFeel pain!\u201d And thereupon it suffereth,\nand thinketh how it may put an end thereto\u2014and for that very purpose it\nIS MEANT to think.", "The Self saith unto the ego: \u201cFeel pleasure!\u201d Thereupon it rejoiceth,\nand thinketh how it may ofttimes rejoice\u2014and for that very purpose it\nIS MEANT to think.\n\nTo the despisers of the body will I speak a word. That they despise is\ncaused by their esteem. What is it that created esteeming and despising\nand worth and will?\n\nThe creating Self created for itself esteeming and despising, it created\nfor itself joy and woe. The creating body created for itself spirit, as\na hand to its will.", "Even in your folly and despising ye each serve your Self, ye despisers\nof the body. I tell you, your very Self wanteth to die, and turneth away\nfrom life.\n\nNo longer can your Self do that which it desireth most:\u2014create beyond\nitself. That is what it desireth most; that is all its fervour.\n\nBut it is now too late to do so:\u2014so your Self wisheth to succumb, ye\ndespisers of the body.", "To succumb\u2014so wisheth your Self; and therefore have ye become despisers\nof the body. For ye can no longer create beyond yourselves.\n\nAnd therefore are ye now angry with life and with the earth. And\nunconscious envy is in the sidelong look of your contempt.\n\nI go not your way, ye despisers of the body! Ye are no bridges for me to\nthe Superman!\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nV. JOYS AND PASSIONS.", "V. JOYS AND PASSIONS.\n\n\nMy brother, when thou hast a virtue, and it is thine own virtue, thou\nhast it in common with no one.\n\nTo be sure, thou wouldst call it by name and caress it; thou wouldst\npull its ears and amuse thyself with it.\n\nAnd lo! Then hast thou its name in common with the people, and hast\nbecome one of the people and the herd with thy virtue!", "Better for thee to say: \u201cIneffable is it, and nameless, that which is\npain and sweetness to my soul, and also the hunger of my bowels.\u201d\n\nLet thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou\nmust speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.\n\nThus speak and stammer: \u201cThat is MY good, that do I love, thus doth it\nplease me entirely, thus only do _I_ desire the good.", "Not as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law or a human\nneed do I desire it; it is not to be a guide-post for me to superearths\nand paradises.\n\nAn earthly virtue is it which I love: little prudence is therein, and\nthe least everyday wisdom.\n\nBut that bird built its nest beside me: therefore, I love and cherish\nit\u2014now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs.\u201d\n\nThus shouldst thou stammer, and praise thy virtue.", "Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But now hast thou only\nthy virtues: they grew out of thy passions.\n\nThou implantedst thy highest aim into the heart of those passions: then\nbecame they thy virtues and joys.\n\nAnd though thou wert of the race of the hot-tempered, or of the\nvoluptuous, or of the fanatical, or the vindictive;\n\nAll thy passions in the end became virtues, and all thy devils angels.", "Once hadst thou wild dogs in thy cellar: but they changed at last into\nbirds and charming songstresses.\n\nOut of thy poisons brewedst thou balsam for thyself; thy cow,\naffliction, milkedst thou\u2014now drinketh thou the sweet milk of her\nudder.\n\nAnd nothing evil groweth in thee any longer, unless it be the evil that\ngroweth out of the conflict of thy virtues.\n\nMy brother, if thou be fortunate, then wilt thou have one virtue and no\nmore: thus goest thou easier over the bridge.", "Illustrious is it to have many virtues, but a hard lot; and many a one\nhath gone into the wilderness and killed himself, because he was weary\nof being the battle and battlefield of virtues.\n\nMy brother, are war and battle evil? Necessary, however, is the evil;\nnecessary are the envy and the distrust and the back-biting among the\nvirtues.", "Lo! how each of thy virtues is covetous of the highest place; it wanteth\nthy whole spirit to be ITS herald, it wanteth thy whole power, in wrath,\nhatred, and love.\n\nJealous is every virtue of the others, and a dreadful thing is jealousy.\nEven virtues may succumb by jealousy.\n\nHe whom the flame of jealousy encompasseth, turneth at last, like the\nscorpion, the poisoned sting against himself.\n\nAh! my brother, hast thou never seen a virtue backbite and stab itself?", "Man is something that hath to be surpassed: and therefore shalt thou\nlove thy virtues,\u2014for thou wilt succumb by them.\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nVI. THE PALE CRIMINAL.\n\n\nYe do not mean to slay, ye judges and sacrificers, until the animal hath\nbowed its head? Lo! the pale criminal hath bowed his head: out of his\neye speaketh the great contempt.\n\n\u201cMine ego is something which is to be surpassed: mine ego is to me the\ngreat contempt of man\u201d: so speaketh it out of that eye.", "When he judged himself\u2014that was his supreme moment; let not the exalted\none relapse again into his low estate!\n\nThere is no salvation for him who thus suffereth from himself, unless it\nbe speedy death.\n\nYour slaying, ye judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; and in that ye\nslay, see to it that ye yourselves justify life!\n\nIt is not enough that ye should reconcile with him whom ye slay. Let\nyour sorrow be love to the Superman: thus will ye justify your own\nsurvival!", "\u201cEnemy\u201d shall ye say but not \u201cvillain,\u201d \u201cinvalid\u201d shall ye say but not\n\u201cwretch,\u201d \u201cfool\u201d shall ye say but not \u201csinner.\u201d\n\nAnd thou, red judge, if thou would say audibly all thou hast done in\nthought, then would every one cry: \u201cAway with the nastiness and the\nvirulent reptile!\u201d\n\nBut one thing is the thought, another thing is the deed, and another\nthing is the idea of the deed. The wheel of causality doth not roll\nbetween them.", "An idea made this pale man pale. Adequate was he for his deed when he\ndid it, but the idea of it, he could not endure when it was done.\n\nEvermore did he now see himself as the doer of one deed. Madness, I call\nthis: the exception reversed itself to the rule in him.\n\nThe streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen; the stroke he struck bewitched\nhis weak reason. Madness AFTER the deed, I call this.", "Hearken, ye judges! There is another madness besides, and it is BEFORE\nthe deed. Ah! ye have not gone deep enough into this soul!\n\nThus speaketh the red judge: \u201cWhy did this criminal commit murder? He\nmeant to rob.\u201d I tell you, however, that his soul wanted blood, not\nbooty: he thirsted for the happiness of the knife!\n\nBut his weak reason understood not this madness, and it persuaded him.\n\u201cWhat matter about blood!\u201d it said; \u201cwishest thou not, at least, to make\nbooty thereby? Or take revenge?\u201d", "And he hearkened unto his weak reason: like lead lay its words upon\nhim\u2014thereupon he robbed when he murdered. He did not mean to be\nashamed of his madness.\n\nAnd now once more lieth the lead of his guilt upon him, and once more is\nhis weak reason so benumbed, so paralysed, and so dull.\n\nCould he only shake his head, then would his burden roll off; but who\nshaketh that head?\n\nWhat is this man? A mass of diseases that reach out into the world\nthrough the spirit; there they want to get their prey.", "What is this man? A coil of wild serpents that are seldom at peace among\nthemselves\u2014so they go forth apart and seek prey in the world.\n\nLook at that poor body! What it suffered and craved, the poor soul\ninterpreted to itself\u2014it interpreted it as murderous desire, and\neagerness for the happiness of the knife.\n\nHim who now turneth sick, the evil overtaketh which is now the evil: he\nseeketh to cause pain with that which causeth him pain. But there have\nbeen other ages, and another evil and good.", "Once was doubt evil, and the will to Self. Then the invalid became a\nheretic or sorcerer; as heretic or sorcerer he suffered, and sought to\ncause suffering.\n\nBut this will not enter your ears; it hurteth your good people, ye tell\nme. But what doth it matter to me about your good people!\n\nMany things in your good people cause me disgust, and verily, not their\nevil. I would that they had a madness by which they succumbed, like this\npale criminal!", "Verily, I would that their madness were called truth, or fidelity,\nor justice: but they have their virtue in order to live long, and in\nwretched self-complacency.\n\nI am a railing alongside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me may\ngrasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not.\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nVII. READING AND WRITING.\n\n\nOf all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his\nblood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit.", "It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading\nidlers.\n\nHe who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another\ncentury of readers\u2014and spirit itself will stink.\n\nEvery one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not\nonly writing but also thinking.\n\nOnce spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh\npopulace.\n\nHe that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be read, but\nlearnt by heart.", "In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that\nroute thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those\nspoken to should be big and tall.\n\nThe atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a\njoyful wickedness: thus are things well matched.\n\nI want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. The courage which\nscareth away ghosts, createth for itself goblins\u2014it wanteth to laugh.", "I no longer feel in common with you; the very cloud which I see\nbeneath me, the blackness and heaviness at which I laugh\u2014that is your\nthunder-cloud.\n\nYe look aloft when ye long for exaltation; and I look downward because I\nam exalted.\n\nWho among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted?\n\nHe who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays\nand tragic realities.", "Courageous, unconcerned, scornful, coercive\u2014so wisdom wisheth us; she\nis a woman, and ever loveth only a warrior.\n\nYe tell me, \u201cLife is hard to bear.\u201d But for what purpose should ye have\nyour pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening?\n\nLife is hard to bear: but do not affect to be so delicate! We are all of\nus fine sumpter asses and assesses.\n\nWhat have we in common with the rose-bud, which trembleth because a drop\nof dew hath formed upon it?", "It is true we love life; not because we are wont to live, but because we\nare wont to love.\n\nThere is always some madness in love. But there is always, also, some\nmethod in madness.\n\nAnd to me also, who appreciate life, the butterflies, and soap-bubbles,\nand whatever is like them amongst us, seem most to enjoy happiness.\n\nTo see these light, foolish, pretty, lively little sprites flit\nabout\u2014that moveth Zarathustra to tears and songs.\n\nI should only believe in a God that would know how to dance.", "And when I saw my devil, I found him serious, thorough, profound,\nsolemn: he was the spirit of gravity\u2014through him all things fall.\n\nNot by wrath, but by laughter, do we slay. Come, let us slay the spirit\nof gravity!\n\nI learned to walk; since then have I let myself run. I learned to fly;\nsince then I do not need pushing in order to move from a spot.\n\nNow am I light, now do I fly; now do I see myself under myself. Now\nthere danceth a God in me.\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.", "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. THE TREE ON THE HILL.\n\n\nZarathustra\u2019s eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him. And as\nhe walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town called\n\u201cThe Pied Cow,\u201d behold, there found he the youth sitting leaning against\na tree, and gazing with wearied look into the valley. Zarathustra\nthereupon laid hold of the tree beside which the youth sat, and spake\nthus:\n\n\u201cIf I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able to\ndo so.", "But the wind, which we see not, troubleth and bendeth it as it listeth.\nWe are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands.\u201d\n\nThereupon the youth arose disconcerted, and said: \u201cI hear Zarathustra,\nand just now was I thinking of him!\u201d Zarathustra answered:\n\n\u201cWhy art thou frightened on that account?\u2014But it is the same with man\nas with the tree.", "The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the more\nvigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and\ndeep\u2014into the evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cYea, into the evil!\u201d cried the youth. \u201cHow is it possible that thou\nhast discovered my soul?\u201d\n\nZarathustra smiled, and said: \u201cMany a soul one will never discover,\nunless one first invent it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYea, into the evil!\u201d cried the youth once more.", "\u201cYea, into the evil!\u201d cried the youth once more.\n\n\u201cThou saidst the truth, Zarathustra. I trust myself no longer since I\nsought to rise into the height, and nobody trusteth me any longer; how\ndoth that happen?\n\nI change too quickly: my to-day refuteth my yesterday. I often overleap\nthe steps when I clamber; for so doing, none of the steps pardons me.\n\nWhen aloft, I find myself always alone. No one speaketh unto me; the\nfrost of solitude maketh me tremble. What do I seek on the height?", "My contempt and my longing increase together; the higher I clamber, the\nmore do I despise him who clambereth. What doth he seek on the height?\n\nHow ashamed I am of my clambering and stumbling! How I mock at my\nviolent panting! How I hate him who flieth! How tired I am on the\nheight!\u201d\n\nHere the youth was silent. And Zarathustra contemplated the tree beside\nwhich they stood, and spake thus:\n\n\u201cThis tree standeth lonely here on the hills; it hath grown up high\nabove man and beast.", "And if it wanted to speak, it would have none who could understand it:\nso high hath it grown.\n\nNow it waiteth and waiteth,\u2014for what doth it wait? It dwelleth too\nclose to the seat of the clouds; it waiteth perhaps for the first\nlightning?\u201d", "When Zarathustra had said this, the youth called out with violent\ngestures: \u201cYea, Zarathustra, thou speakest the truth. My destruction\nI longed for, when I desired to be on the height, and thou art the\nlightning for which I waited! Lo! what have I been since thou hast\nappeared amongst us? It is mine envy of thee that hath destroyed\nme!\u201d\u2014Thus spake the youth, and wept bitterly. Zarathustra, however, put\nhis arm about him, and led the youth away with him.", "And when they had walked a while together, Zarathustra began to speak\nthus:\n\nIt rendeth my heart. Better than thy words express it, thine eyes tell\nme all thy danger.\n\nAs yet thou art not free; thou still SEEKEST freedom. Too unslept hath\nthy seeking made thee, and too wakeful.\n\nOn the open height wouldst thou be; for the stars thirsteth thy soul.\nBut thy bad impulses also thirst for freedom.", "Thy wild dogs want liberty; they bark for joy in their cellar when thy\nspirit endeavoureth to open all prison doors.\n\nStill art thou a prisoner\u2014it seemeth to me\u2014who deviseth liberty\nfor himself: ah! sharp becometh the soul of such prisoners, but also\ndeceitful and wicked.\n\nTo purify himself, is still necessary for the freedman of the spirit.\nMuch of the prison and the mould still remaineth in him: pure hath his\neye still to become.", "Yea, I know thy danger. But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not\nthy love and hope away!\n\nNoble thou feelest thyself still, and noble others also feel thee still,\nthough they bear thee a grudge and cast evil looks. Know this, that to\neverybody a noble one standeth in the way.\n\nAlso to the good, a noble one standeth in the way: and even when they\ncall him a good man, they want thereby to put him aside.", "The new, would the noble man create, and a new virtue. The old, wanteth\nthe good man, and that the old should be conserved.\n\nBut it is not the danger of the noble man to turn a good man, but lest\nhe should become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer.\n\nAh! I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope. And then they\ndisparaged all high hopes.\n\nThen lived they shamelessly in temporary pleasures, and beyond the day\nhad hardly an aim.", "\u201cSpirit is also voluptuousness,\u201d\u2014said they. Then broke the wings of\ntheir spirit; and now it creepeth about, and defileth where it gnaweth.\n\nOnce they thought of becoming heroes; but sensualists are they now. A\ntrouble and a terror is the hero to them.\n\nBut by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not away the hero in thy\nsoul! Maintain holy thy highest hope!\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nIX. THE PREACHERS OF DEATH.", "IX. THE PREACHERS OF DEATH.\n\n\nThere are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to whom\ndesistance from life must be preached.\n\nFull is the earth of the superfluous; marred is life by the\nmany-too-many. May they be decoyed out of this life by the \u201clife\neternal\u201d!\n\n\u201cThe yellow ones\u201d: so are called the preachers of death, or \u201cthe black\nones.\u201d But I will show them unto you in other colours besides.", "There are the terrible ones who carry about in themselves the beast of\nprey, and have no choice except lusts or self-laceration. And even their\nlusts are self-laceration.\n\nThey have not yet become men, those terrible ones: may they preach\ndesistance from life, and pass away themselves!\n\nThere are the spiritually consumptive ones: hardly are they born when\nthey begin to die, and long for doctrines of lassitude and renunciation.", "They would fain be dead, and we should approve of their wish! Let\nus beware of awakening those dead ones, and of damaging those living\ncoffins!\n\nThey meet an invalid, or an old man, or a corpse\u2014and immediately they\nsay: \u201cLife is refuted!\u201d\n\nBut they only are refuted, and their eye, which seeth only one aspect of\nexistence.\n\nShrouded in thick melancholy, and eager for the little casualties that\nbring death: thus do they wait, and clench their teeth.", "Or else, they grasp at sweetmeats, and mock at their childishness\nthereby: they cling to their straw of life, and mock at their still\nclinging to it.\n\nTheir wisdom speaketh thus: \u201cA fool, he who remaineth alive; but so far\nare we fools! And that is the foolishest thing in life!\u201d\n\n\u201cLife is only suffering\u201d: so say others, and lie not. Then see to it\nthat YE cease! See to it that the life ceaseth which is only suffering!", "And let this be the teaching of your virtue: \u201cThou shalt slay thyself!\nThou shalt steal away from thyself!\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cLust is sin,\u201d\u2014so say some who preach death\u2014\u201clet us go apart and beget\nno children!\u201d\n\n\u201cGiving birth is troublesome,\u201d\u2014say others\u2014\u201cwhy still give birth? One\nbeareth only the unfortunate!\u201d And they also are preachers of death.\n\n\u201cPity is necessary,\u201d\u2014so saith a third party. \u201cTake what I have! Take\nwhat I am! So much less doth life bind me!\u201d", "Were they consistently pitiful, then would they make their neighbours\nsick of life. To be wicked\u2014that would be their true goodness.\n\nBut they want to be rid of life; what care they if they bind others\nstill faster with their chains and gifts!\u2014\n\nAnd ye also, to whom life is rough labour and disquiet, are ye not very\ntired of life? Are ye not very ripe for the sermon of death?", "All ye to whom rough labour is dear, and the rapid, new, and strange\u2014ye\nput up with yourselves badly; your diligence is flight, and the will to\nself-forgetfulness.\n\nIf ye believed more in life, then would ye devote yourselves less to the\nmomentary. But for waiting, ye have not enough of capacity in you\u2014nor\neven for idling!\n\nEverywhere resoundeth the voices of those who preach death; and the\nearth is full of those to whom death hath to be preached.", "Or \u201clife eternal\u201d; it is all the same to me\u2014if only they pass away\nquickly!\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nX. WAR AND WARRIORS.\n\n\nBy our best enemies we do not want to be spared, nor by those either\nwhom we love from the very heart. So let me tell you the truth!\n\nMy brethren in war! I love you from the very heart. I am, and was ever,\nyour counterpart. And I am also your best enemy. So let me tell you the\ntruth!", "I know the hatred and envy of your hearts. Ye are not great enough not\nto know of hatred and envy. Then be great enough not to be ashamed of\nthem!\n\nAnd if ye cannot be saints of knowledge, then, I pray you, be at least\nits warriors. They are the companions and forerunners of such saintship.\n\nI see many soldiers; could I but see many warriors! \u201cUniform\u201d one\ncalleth what they wear; may it not be uniform what they therewith hide!", "Ye shall be those whose eyes ever seek for an enemy\u2014for YOUR enemy. And\nwith some of you there is hatred at first sight.\n\nYour enemy shall ye seek; your war shall ye wage, and for the sake of\nyour thoughts! And if your thoughts succumb, your uprightness shall\nstill shout triumph thereby!\n\nYe shall love peace as a means to new wars\u2014and the short peace more\nthan the long.", "You I advise not to work, but to fight. You I advise not to peace, but\nto victory. Let your work be a fight, let your peace be a victory!\n\nOne can only be silent and sit peacefully when one hath arrow and bow;\notherwise one prateth and quarrelleth. Let your peace be a victory!\n\nYe say it is the good cause which halloweth even war? I say unto you: it\nis the good war which halloweth every cause.", "War and courage have done more great things than charity. Not your\nsympathy, but your bravery hath hitherto saved the victims.\n\n\u201cWhat is good?\u201d ye ask. To be brave is good. Let the little girls say:\n\u201cTo be good is what is pretty, and at the same time touching.\u201d\n\nThey call you heartless: but your heart is true, and I love the\nbashfulness of your good-will. Ye are ashamed of your flow, and others\nare ashamed of their ebb.", "Ye are ugly? Well then, my brethren, take the sublime about you, the\nmantle of the ugly!\n\nAnd when your soul becometh great, then doth it become haughty, and in\nyour sublimity there is wickedness. I know you.\n\nIn wickedness the haughty man and the weakling meet. But they\nmisunderstand one another. I know you.\n\nYe shall only have enemies to be hated, but not enemies to be despised.\nYe must be proud of your enemies; then, the successes of your enemies\nare also your successes.", "Resistance\u2014that is the distinction of the slave. Let your distinction\nbe obedience. Let your commanding itself be obeying!\n\nTo the good warrior soundeth \u201cthou shalt\u201d pleasanter than \u201cI will.\u201d And\nall that is dear unto you, ye shall first have it commanded unto you.\n\nLet your love to life be love to your highest hope; and let your highest\nhope be the highest thought of life!", "Your highest thought, however, ye shall have it commanded unto you by\nme\u2014and it is this: man is something that is to be surpassed.\n\nSo live your life of obedience and of war! What matter about long life!\nWhat warrior wisheth to be spared!\n\nI spare you not, I love you from my very heart, my brethren in war!\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXI. THE NEW IDOL.\n\n\nSomewhere there are still peoples and herds, but not with us, my\nbrethren: here there are states.", "A state? What is that? Well! open now your ears unto me, for now will I\nsay unto you my word concerning the death of peoples.\n\nA state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth\nit also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: \u201cI, the state, am the\npeople.\u201d\n\nIt is a lie! Creators were they who created peoples, and hung a faith\nand a love over them: thus they served life.", "Destroyers, are they who lay snares for many, and call it the state:\nthey hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them.\n\nWhere there is still a people, there the state is not understood, but\nhated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and customs.\n\nThis sign I give unto you: every people speaketh its language of good\nand evil: this its neighbour understandeth not. Its language hath it\ndevised for itself in laws and customs.", "But the state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it\nsaith it lieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen.\n\nFalse is everything in it; with stolen teeth it biteth, the biting one.\nFalse are even its bowels.\n\nConfusion of language of good and evil; this sign I give unto you as\nthe sign of the state. Verily, the will to death, indicateth this sign!\nVerily, it beckoneth unto the preachers of death!\n\nMany too many are born: for the superfluous ones was the state devised!", "See just how it enticeth them to it, the many-too-many! How it\nswalloweth and cheweth and recheweth them!\n\n\u201cOn earth there is nothing greater than I: it is I who am the regulating\nfinger of God\u201d\u2014thus roareth the monster. And not only the long-eared\nand short-sighted fall upon their knees!\n\nAh! even in your ears, ye great souls, it whispereth its gloomy lies!\nAh! it findeth out the rich hearts which willingly lavish themselves!", "Yea, it findeth you out too, ye conquerors of the old God! Weary ye\nbecame of the conflict, and now your weariness serveth the new idol!\n\nHeroes and honourable ones, it would fain set up around it, the new\nidol! Gladly it basketh in the sunshine of good consciences,\u2014the cold\nmonster!\n\nEverything will it give YOU, if YE worship it, the new idol: thus it\npurchaseth the lustre of your virtue, and the glance of your proud eyes.", "It seeketh to allure by means of you, the many-too-many! Yea, a hellish\nartifice hath here been devised, a death-horse jingling with the\ntrappings of divine honours!\n\nYea, a dying for many hath here been devised, which glorifieth itself as\nlife: verily, a hearty service unto all preachers of death!\n\nThe state, I call it, where all are poison-drinkers, the good and the\nbad: the state, where all lose themselves, the good and the bad: the\nstate, where the slow suicide of all\u2014is called \u201clife.\u201d", "Just see these superfluous ones! They steal the works of the inventors\nand the treasures of the wise. Culture, they call their theft\u2014and\neverything becometh sickness and trouble unto them!\n\nJust see these superfluous ones! Sick are they always; they vomit their\nbile and call it a newspaper. They devour one another, and cannot even\ndigest themselves.", "Just see these superfluous ones! Wealth they acquire and become poorer\nthereby. Power they seek for, and above all, the lever of power, much\nmoney\u2014these impotent ones!\n\nSee them clamber, these nimble apes! They clamber over one another, and\nthus scuffle into the mud and the abyss.\n\nTowards the throne they all strive: it is their madness\u2014as if happiness\nsat on the throne! Ofttimes sitteth filth on the throne.\u2014and ofttimes\nalso the throne on filth.", "Madmen they all seem to me, and clambering apes, and too eager. Badly\nsmelleth their idol to me, the cold monster: badly they all smell to me,\nthese idolaters.\n\nMy brethren, will ye suffocate in the fumes of their maws and appetites!\nBetter break the windows and jump into the open air!\n\nDo go out of the way of the bad odour! Withdraw from the idolatry of the\nsuperfluous!\n\nDo go out of the way of the bad odour! Withdraw from the steam of these\nhuman sacrifices!", "Open still remaineth the earth for great souls. Empty are still many\nsites for lone ones and twain ones, around which floateth the odour of\ntranquil seas.\n\nOpen still remaineth a free life for great souls. Verily, he who\npossesseth little is so much the less possessed: blessed be moderate\npoverty!\n\nThere, where the state ceaseth\u2014there only commenceth the man who is not\nsuperfluous: there commenceth the song of the necessary ones, the single\nand irreplaceable melody.", "There, where the state CEASETH\u2014pray look thither, my brethren! Do ye\nnot see it, the rainbow and the bridges of the Superman?\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXII. THE FLIES IN THE MARKET-PLACE.\n\n\nFlee, my friend, into thy solitude! I see thee deafened with the noise\nof the great men, and stung all over with the stings of the little ones.", "Admirably do forest and rock know how to be silent with thee. Resemble\nagain the tree which thou lovest, the broad-branched one\u2014silently and\nattentively it o\u2019erhangeth the sea.\n\nWhere solitude endeth, there beginneth the market-place; and where the\nmarket-place beginneth, there beginneth also the noise of the great\nactors, and the buzzing of the poison-flies.\n\nIn the world even the best things are worthless without those who\nrepresent them: those representers, the people call great men.", "Little do the people understand what is great\u2014that is to say, the\ncreating agency. But they have a taste for all representers and actors\nof great things.\n\nAround the devisers of new values revolveth the world:\u2014invisibly it\nrevolveth. But around the actors revolve the people and the glory: such\nis the course of things.\n\nSpirit, hath the actor, but little conscience of the spirit. He\nbelieveth always in that wherewith he maketh believe most strongly\u2014in\nHIMSELF!", "To-morrow he hath a new belief, and the day after, one still newer. Sharp\nperceptions hath he, like the people, and changeable humours.\n\nTo upset\u2014that meaneth with him to prove. To drive mad\u2014that meaneth\nwith him to convince. And blood is counted by him as the best of all\narguments.\n\nA truth which only glideth into fine ears, he calleth falsehood and\ntrumpery. Verily, he believeth only in Gods that make a great noise in\nthe world!", "Full of clattering buffoons is the market-place,\u2014and the people glory\nin their great men! These are for them the masters of the hour.\n\nBut the hour presseth them; so they press thee. And also from thee\nthey want Yea or Nay. Alas! thou wouldst set thy chair betwixt For and\nAgainst?\n\nOn account of those absolute and impatient ones, be not jealous, thou\nlover of truth! Never yet did truth cling to the arm of an absolute one.", "On account of those abrupt ones, return into thy security: only in the\nmarket-place is one assailed by Yea? or Nay?\n\nSlow is the experience of all deep fountains: long have they to wait\nuntil they know WHAT hath fallen into their depths.\n\nAway from the market-place and from fame taketh place all that is great:\naway from the market-place and from fame have ever dwelt the devisers of\nnew values.", "Flee, my friend, into thy solitude: I see thee stung all over by the\npoisonous flies. Flee thither, where a rough, strong breeze bloweth!\n\nFlee into thy solitude! Thou hast lived too closely to the small and the\npitiable. Flee from their invisible vengeance! Towards thee they have\nnothing but vengeance.\n\nRaise no longer an arm against them! Innumerable are they, and it is not\nthy lot to be a fly-flap.", "Innumerable are the small and pitiable ones; and of many a proud\nstructure, rain-drops and weeds have been the ruin.\n\nThou art not stone; but already hast thou become hollow by the numerous\ndrops. Thou wilt yet break and burst by the numerous drops.\n\nExhausted I see thee, by poisonous flies; bleeding I see thee, and torn\nat a hundred spots; and thy pride will not even upbraid.", "Blood they would have from thee in all innocence; blood their bloodless\nsouls crave for\u2014and they sting, therefore, in all innocence.\n\nBut thou, profound one, thou sufferest too profoundly even from small\nwounds; and ere thou hadst recovered, the same poison-worm crawled over\nthy hand.\n\nToo proud art thou to kill these sweet-tooths. But take care lest it be\nthy fate to suffer all their poisonous injustice!", "They buzz around thee also with their praise: obtrusiveness, is their\npraise. They want to be close to thy skin and thy blood.\n\nThey flatter thee, as one flattereth a God or devil; they whimper before\nthee, as before a God or devil. What doth it come to! Flatterers are\nthey, and whimperers, and nothing more.\n\nOften, also, do they show themselves to thee as amiable ones. But that\nhath ever been the prudence of the cowardly. Yea! the cowardly are wise!", "They think much about thee with their circumscribed souls\u2014thou art\nalways suspected by them! Whatever is much thought about is at last\nthought suspicious.\n\nThey punish thee for all thy virtues. They pardon thee in their inmost\nhearts only\u2014for thine errors.\n\nBecause thou art gentle and of upright character, thou sayest:\n\u201cBlameless are they for their small existence.\u201d But their circumscribed\nsouls think: \u201cBlamable is all great existence.\u201d", "Even when thou art gentle towards them, they still feel themselves\ndespised by thee; and they repay thy beneficence with secret\nmaleficence.\n\nThy silent pride is always counter to their taste; they rejoice if once\nthou be humble enough to be frivolous.\n\nWhat we recognise in a man, we also irritate in him. Therefore be on\nyour guard against the small ones!\n\nIn thy presence they feel themselves small, and their baseness gleameth\nand gloweth against thee in invisible vengeance.", "Sawest thou not how often they became dumb when thou approachedst them,\nand how their energy left them like the smoke of an extinguishing fire?\n\nYea, my friend, the bad conscience art thou of thy neighbours; for they\nare unworthy of thee. Therefore they hate thee, and would fain suck thy\nblood.\n\nThy neighbours will always be poisonous flies; what is great in\nthee\u2014that itself must make them more poisonous, and always more\nfly-like.", "Flee, my friend, into thy solitude\u2014and thither, where a rough strong\nbreeze bloweth. It is not thy lot to be a fly-flap.\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXIII. CHASTITY.\n\n\nI love the forest. It is bad to live in cities: there, there are too\nmany of the lustful.\n\nIs it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer, than into the\ndreams of a lustful woman?\n\nAnd just look at these men: their eye saith it\u2014they know nothing better\non earth than to lie with a woman.", "Filth is at the bottom of their souls; and alas! if their filth hath\nstill spirit in it!\n\nWould that ye were perfect\u2014at least as animals! But to animals\nbelongeth innocence.\n\nDo I counsel you to slay your instincts? I counsel you to innocence in\nyour instincts.\n\nDo I counsel you to chastity? Chastity is a virtue with some, but with\nmany almost a vice.\n\nThese are continent, to be sure: but doggish lust looketh enviously out\nof all that they do.", "Even into the heights of their virtue and into their cold spirit doth\nthis creature follow them, with its discord.\n\nAnd how nicely can doggish lust beg for a piece of spirit, when a piece\nof flesh is denied it!\n\nYe love tragedies and all that breaketh the heart? But I am distrustful\nof your doggish lust.\n\nYe have too cruel eyes, and ye look wantonly towards the sufferers.\nHath not your lust just disguised itself and taken the name of\nfellow-suffering?", "And also this parable give I unto you: Not a few who meant to cast out\ntheir devil, went thereby into the swine themselves.\n\nTo whom chastity is difficult, it is to be dissuaded: lest it become the\nroad to hell\u2014to filth and lust of soul.\n\nDo I speak of filthy things? That is not the worst thing for me to do.\n\nNot when the truth is filthy, but when it is shallow, doth the\ndiscerning one go unwillingly into its waters.", "Verily, there are chaste ones from their very nature; they are gentler\nof heart, and laugh better and oftener than you.\n\nThey laugh also at chastity, and ask: \u201cWhat is chastity?\n\nIs chastity not folly? But the folly came unto us, and not we unto it.\n\nWe offered that guest harbour and heart: now it dwelleth with us\u2014let it\nstay as long as it will!\u201d\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXIV. THE FRIEND.", "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXIV. THE FRIEND.\n\n\n\u201cOne, is always too many about me\u201d\u2014thinketh the anchorite. \u201cAlways once\none\u2014that maketh two in the long run!\u201d\n\nI and me are always too earnestly in conversation: how could it be\nendured, if there were not a friend?\n\nThe friend of the anchorite is always the third one: the third one is\nthe cork which preventeth the conversation of the two sinking into the\ndepth.", "Ah! there are too many depths for all anchorites. Therefore, do they\nlong so much for a friend, and for his elevation.\n\nOur faith in others betrayeth wherein we would fain have faith in\nourselves. Our longing for a friend is our betrayer.\n\nAnd often with our love we want merely to overleap envy. And often we\nattack and make ourselves enemies, to conceal that we are vulnerable.\n\n\u201cBe at least mine enemy!\u201d\u2014thus speaketh the true reverence, which doth\nnot venture to solicit friendship.", "If one would have a friend, then must one also be willing to wage war\nfor him: and in order to wage war, one must be CAPABLE of being an\nenemy.\n\nOne ought still to honour the enemy in one\u2019s friend. Canst thou go nigh\nunto thy friend, and not go over to him?\n\nIn one\u2019s friend one shall have one\u2019s best enemy. Thou shalt be closest\nunto him with thy heart when thou withstandest him.", "Thou wouldst wear no raiment before thy friend? It is in honour of thy\nfriend that thou showest thyself to him as thou art?

O my friend, man is something that hath to be surpassed.\n\nIn divining and keeping silence shall the friend be a master: not\neverything must thou wish to see. Thy dream shall disclose unto thee\nwhat thy friend doeth when awake.", "Let thy pity be a divining: to know first if thy friend wanteth pity.\nPerhaps he loveth in thee the unmoved eye, and the look of eternity.\n\nLet thy pity for thy friend be hid under a hard shell; thou shalt bite\nout a tooth upon it. Thus will it have delicacy and sweetness.\n\nArt thou pure air and solitude and bread and medicine to thy friend?\nMany a one cannot loosen his own fetters, but is nevertheless his\nfriend\u2019s emancipator.", "Art thou a slave? Then thou canst not be a friend. Art thou a tyrant?\nThen thou canst not have friends.\n\nFar too long hath there been a slave and a tyrant concealed in woman.\nOn that account woman is not yet capable of friendship: she knoweth only\nlove.\n\nIn woman\u2019s love there is injustice and blindness to all she doth not\nlove.

As much as ye\ngive to your friend, will I give even to my foe, and will not have\nbecome poorer thereby.\n\nThere is comradeship: may there be friendship!\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXV. THE THOUSAND AND ONE GOALS.", "XV. THE THOUSAND AND ONE GOALS.\n\n\nMany lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples: thus he discovered the\ngood and bad of many peoples. No greater power did Zarathustra find on\nearth than good and bad.\n\nNo people could live without first valuing; if a people will maintain\nitself, however, it must not value as its neighbour valueth.", "Much that passed for good with one people was regarded with scorn and\ncontempt by another: thus I found it.

NEIGHBOUR-LOVE.", "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXVI. NEIGHBOUR-LOVE.\n\n\nYe crowd around your neighbour, and have fine words for it. But I say\nunto you: your neighbour-love is your bad love of yourselves.\n\nYe flee unto your neighbour from yourselves, and would fain make a\nvirtue thereof: but I fathom your \u201cunselfishness.\u201d\n\nThe THOU is older than the _I_; the THOU hath been consecrated, but not\nyet the _I_: so man presseth nigh unto his neighbour.", "Do I advise you to neighbour-love?

Thou wilt one day cry: \u201cI am alone!\u201d\n\nOne day wilt thou see no longer thy loftiness, and see too closely thy\nlowliness; thy sublimity itself will frighten thee as a phantom.

What knoweth\nhe of love who hath not been obliged to despise just what he loved!", "With thy love, go into thine isolation, my brother, and with thy\ncreating; and late only will justice limp after thee.\n\nWith my tears, go into thine isolation, my brother. I love him who\nseeketh to create beyond himself, and thus succumbeth.\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII. OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN.\n\n\n\u201cWhy stealest thou along so furtively in the twilight, Zarathustra? And\nwhat hidest thou so carefully under thy mantle?", "Is it a treasure that hath been given thee? Or a child that hath been\nborn thee? Or goest thou thyself on a thief\u2019s errand, thou friend of the\nevil?\u201d\u2014\n\nVerily, my brother, said Zarathustra, it is a treasure that hath been\ngiven me: it is a little truth which I carry.\n\nBut it is naughty, like a young child; and if I hold not its mouth, it\nscreameth too loudly.\n\nAs I went on my way alone to-day, at the hour when the sun declineth,\nthere met me an old woman, and she spake thus unto my soul:", "\u201cMuch hath Zarathustra spoken also to us women, but never spake he unto\nus concerning woman.\u201d\n\nAnd I answered her: \u201cConcerning woman, one should only talk unto men.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk also unto me of woman,\u201d said she; \u201cI am old enough to forget it\npresently.\u201d\n\nAnd I obliged the old woman and spake thus unto her:\n\nEverything in woman is a riddle, and everything in woman hath one\nsolution\u2014it is called pregnancy.\n\nMan is for woman a means: the purpose is always the child. But what is\nwoman for man?", "Two different things wanteth the true man: danger and diversion.\nTherefore wanteth he woman, as the most dangerous plaything.\n\nMan shall be trained for war, and woman for the recreation of the\nwarrior: all else is folly.\n\nToo sweet fruits\u2014these the warrior liketh not. Therefore liketh he\nwoman;\u2014bitter is even the sweetest woman.\n\nBetter than man doth woman understand children, but man is more childish\nthan woman.", "In the true man there is a child hidden: it wanteth to play. Up then, ye\nwomen, and discover the child in man!\n\nA plaything let woman be, pure and fine like the precious stone,\nillumined with the virtues of a world not yet come.\n\nLet the beam of a star shine in your love! Let your hope say: \u201cMay I\nbear the Superman!\u201d\n\nIn your love let there be valour! With your love shall ye assail him who\ninspireth you with fear!", "In your love be your honour! Little doth woman understand otherwise\nabout honour. But let this be your honour: always to love more than ye\nare loved, and never be the second.\n\nLet man fear woman when she loveth: then maketh she every sacrifice, and\neverything else she regardeth as worthless.\n\nLet man fear woman when she hateth: for man in his innermost soul is\nmerely evil; woman, however, is mean.", "Whom hateth woman most?\u2014Thus spake the iron to the loadstone: \u201cI hate\nthee most, because thou attractest, but art too weak to draw unto thee.\u201d\n\nThe happiness of man is, \u201cI will.\u201d The happiness of woman is, \u201cHe will.\u201d\n\n\u201cLo! now hath the world become perfect!\u201d\u2014thus thinketh every woman when\nshe obeyeth with all her love.\n\nObey, must the woman, and find a depth for her surface. Surface, is\nwoman\u2019s soul, a mobile, stormy film on shallow water.", "Man\u2019s soul, however, is deep, its current gusheth in subterranean\ncaverns: woman surmiseth its force, but comprehendeth it not.\u2014\n\nThen answered me the old woman: \u201cMany fine things hath Zarathustra said,\nespecially for those who are young enough for them.\n\nStrange! Zarathustra knoweth little about woman, and yet he is right\nabout them! Doth this happen, because with women nothing is impossible?\n\nAnd now accept a little truth by way of thanks! I am old enough for it!", "Swaddle it up and hold its mouth: otherwise it will scream too loudly,\nthe little truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me, woman, thy little truth!\u201d said I. And thus spake the old\nwoman:\n\n\u201cThou goest to women? Do not forget thy whip!\u201d\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXIX. THE BITE OF THE ADDER.", "One day had Zarathustra fallen asleep under a fig-tree, owing to the\nheat, with his arms over his face. And there came an adder and bit him\nin the neck, so that Zarathustra screamed with pain. When he had\ntaken his arm from his face he looked at the serpent; and then did it\nrecognise the eyes of Zarathustra, wriggled awkwardly, and tried to get\naway. \u201cNot at all,\u201d said Zarathustra, \u201cas yet hast thou not received\nmy thanks! Thou hast awakened me in time; my journey is yet long.\u201d", "\u201cThy journey is short,\u201d said the adder sadly; \u201cmy poison is fatal.\u201d\n Zarathustra smiled. \u201cWhen did ever a dragon die of a serpent\u2019s\npoison?\u201d\u2014said he. \u201cBut take thy poison back! Thou art not rich enough\nto present it to me.\u201d Then fell the adder again on his neck, and licked\nhis wound.", "When Zarathustra once told this to his disciples they asked him:\n\u201cAnd what, O Zarathustra, is the moral of thy story?\u201d And Zarathustra\nanswered them thus:\n\nThe destroyer of morality, the good and just call me: my story is\nimmoral.\n\nWhen, however, ye have an enemy, then return him not good for evil: for\nthat would abash him. But prove that he hath done something good to you.", "And rather be angry than abash any one! And when ye are cursed, it\npleaseth me not that ye should then desire to bless. Rather curse a\nlittle also!\n\nAnd should a great injustice befall you, then do quickly five small ones\nbesides. Hideous to behold is he on whom injustice presseth alone.\n\nDid ye ever know this? Shared injustice is half justice. And he who can\nbear it, shall take the injustice upon himself!", "A small revenge is humaner than no revenge at all. And if the punishment\nbe not also a right and an honour to the transgressor, I do not like\nyour punishing.\n\nNobler is it to own oneself in the wrong than to establish one\u2019s right,\nespecially if one be in the right. Only, one must be rich enough to do\nso.\n\nI do not like your cold justice; out of the eye of your judges there\nalways glanceth the executioner and his cold steel.\n\nTell me: where find we justice, which is love with seeing eyes?", "Devise me, then, the love which not only beareth all punishment, but\nalso all guilt!\n\nDevise me, then, the justice which acquitteth every one except the\njudge!\n\nAnd would ye hear this likewise? To him who seeketh to be just from the\nheart, even the lie becometh philanthropy.\n\nBut how could I be just from the heart! How can I give every one his\nown! Let this be enough for me: I give unto every one mine own.", "Finally, my brethren, guard against doing wrong to any anchorite. How\ncould an anchorite forget! How could he requite!\n\nLike a deep well is an anchorite. Easy is it to throw in a stone: if\nit should sink to the bottom, however, tell me, who will bring it out\nagain?\n\nGuard against injuring the anchorite! If ye have done so, however, well\nthen, kill him also!\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXX. CHILD AND MARRIAGE.", "XX. CHILD AND MARRIAGE.\n\n\nI have a question for thee alone, my brother: like a sounding-lead, cast\nI this question into thy soul, that I may know its depth.\n\nThou art young, and desirest child and marriage. But I ask thee: Art\nthou a man ENTITLED to desire a child?\n\nArt thou the victorious one, the self-conqueror, the ruler of thy\npassions, the master of thy virtues? Thus do I ask thee.\n\nOr doth the animal speak in thy wish, and necessity? Or isolation? Or\ndiscord in thee?", "I would have thy victory and freedom long for a child. Living monuments\nshalt thou build to thy victory and emancipation.\n\nBeyond thyself shalt thou build. But first of all must thou be built\nthyself, rectangular in body and soul.\n\nNot only onward shalt thou propagate thyself, but upward! For that\npurpose may the garden of marriage help thee!\n\nA higher body shalt thou create, a first movement, a spontaneously\nrolling wheel\u2014a creating one shalt thou create.", "Marriage: so call I the will of the twain to create the one that is\nmore than those who created it. The reverence for one another, as those\nexercising such a will, call I marriage.\n\nLet this be the significance and the truth of thy marriage. But that\nwhich the many-too-many call marriage, those superfluous ones\u2014ah, what\nshall I call it?\n\nAh, the poverty of soul in the twain! Ah, the filth of soul in the\ntwain! Ah, the pitiable self-complacency in the twain!", "Marriage they call it all; and they say their marriages are made in\nheaven.\n\nWell, I do not like it, that heaven of the superfluous! No, I do not\nlike them, those animals tangled in the heavenly toils!\n\nFar from me also be the God who limpeth thither to bless what he hath\nnot matched!\n\nLaugh not at such marriages! What child hath not had reason to weep over\nits parents?", "Worthy did this man seem, and ripe for the meaning of the earth: but\nwhen I saw his wife, the earth seemed to me a home for madcaps.\n\nYea, I would that the earth shook with convulsions when a saint and a\ngoose mate with one another.\n\nThis one went forth in quest of truth as a hero, and at last got for\nhimself a small decked-up lie: his marriage he calleth it.\n\nThat one was reserved in intercourse and chose choicely. But one time he\nspoilt his company for all time: his marriage he calleth it.", "Another sought a handmaid with the virtues of an angel. But all at once\nhe became the handmaid of a woman, and now would he need also to become\nan angel.\n\nCareful, have I found all buyers, and all of them have astute eyes. But\neven the astutest of them buyeth his wife in a sack.\n\nMany short follies\u2014that is called love by you. And your marriage\nputteth an end to many short follies, with one long stupidity.", "Your love to woman, and woman\u2019s love to man\u2014ah, would that it were\nsympathy for suffering and veiled deities! But generally two animals\nalight on one another.\n\nBut even your best love is only an enraptured simile and a painful\nardour. It is a torch to light you to loftier paths.\n\nBeyond yourselves shall ye love some day! Then LEARN first of all to\nlove. And on that account ye had to drink the bitter cup of your love.", "Bitterness is in the cup even of the best love: thus doth it cause\nlonging for the Superman; thus doth it cause thirst in thee, the\ncreating one!\n\nThirst in the creating one, arrow and longing for the Superman: tell me,\nmy brother, is this thy will to marriage?\n\nHoly call I such a will, and such a marriage.\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXXI. VOLUNTARY DEATH.\n\n\nMany die too late, and some die too early.

THE PRIESTS.\n\n\nAnd one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples, and spake these\nwords unto them:\n\n\u201cHere are priests: but although they are mine enemies, pass them quietly\nand with sleeping swords!\n\nEven among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too much\u2014:\nso they want to make others suffer.\n\nBad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.\nAnd readily doth he soil himself who toucheth them.", "But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood\nhonoured in theirs.\u201d\u2014\n\nAnd when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long had\nhe struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:\n\nIt moveth my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but\nthat is the smallest matter unto me, since I am among men.\n\nBut I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they unto me,\nand stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:\u2014", "In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would\nsave them from their Saviour!\n\nOn an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed them\nabout; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!\n\nFalse values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for\nmortals\u2014long slumbereth and waiteth the fate that is in them.\n\nBut at last it cometh and awaketh and devoureth and engulfeth whatever\nhath built tabernacles upon it.", "Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built\nthemselves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!\n\nOh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul\u2014may not\nfly aloft to its height!\n\nBut so enjoineth their belief: \u201cOn your knees, up the stair, ye\nsinners!\u201d\n\nVerily, rather would I see a shameless one than the distorted eyes of\ntheir shame and devotion!", "Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it not\nthose who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under the clear\nsky?\n\nAnd only when the clear sky looketh again through ruined roofs, and down\nupon grass and red poppies on ruined walls\u2014will I again turn my heart\nto the seats of this God.\n\nThey called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily, there\nwas much hero-spirit in their worship!", "And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing men to\nthe cross!\n\nAs corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;\neven in their talk do I still feel the evil flavour of charnel-houses.\n\nAnd he who liveth nigh unto them liveth nigh unto black pools, wherein\nthe toad singeth his song with sweet gravity.\n\nBetter songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their\nSaviour: more like saved ones would his disciples have to appear unto\nme!", "Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach\npenitence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!\n\nVerily, their Saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom\u2019s\nseventh heaven! Verily, they themselves never trod the carpets of\nknowledge!\n\nOf defects did the spirit of those Saviours consist; but into every\ndefect had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called\nGod.", "In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and\no\u2019erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great\nfolly.\n\nEagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;\nas if there were but one foot-bridge to the future!

Ye want reward for virtue,\nand heaven for earth, and eternity for your to-day?\n\nAnd now ye upbraid me for teaching that there is no reward-giver,\nnor paymaster? And verily, I do not even teach that virtue is its own\nreward.\n\nAh! this is my sorrow: into the basis of things have reward and\npunishment been insinuated\u2014and now even into the basis of your souls,\nye virtuous ones!", "But like the snout of the boar shall my word grub up the basis of your\nsouls; a ploughshare will I be called by you.\n\nAll the secrets of your heart shall be brought to light; and when ye\nlie in the sun, grubbed up and broken, then will also your falsehood be\nseparated from your truth.\n\nFor this is your truth: ye are TOO PURE for the filth of the words:\nvengeance, punishment, recompense, retribution.", "Ye love your virtue as a mother loveth her child; but when did one hear\nof a mother wanting to be paid for her love?\n\nIt is your dearest Self, your virtue. The ring\u2019s thirst is in you: to\nreach itself again struggleth every ring, and turneth itself.\n\nAnd like the star that goeth out, so is every work of your virtue: ever\nis its light on its way and travelling\u2014and when will it cease to be on\nits way?", "Thus is the light of your virtue still on its way, even when its work\nis done. Be it forgotten and dead, still its ray of light liveth and\ntravelleth.\n\nThat your virtue is your Self, and not an outward thing, a skin, or\na cloak: that is the truth from the basis of your souls, ye virtuous\nones!\u2014\n\nBut sure enough there are those to whom virtue meaneth writhing under\nthe lash: and ye have hearkened too much unto their crying!", "And others are there who call virtue the slothfulness of their vices;\nand when once their hatred and jealousy relax the limbs, their \u201cjustice\u201d\n becometh lively and rubbeth its sleepy eyes.\n\nAnd others are there who are drawn downwards: their devils draw them.\nBut the more they sink, the more ardently gloweth their eye, and the\nlonging for their God.\n\nAh! their crying also hath reached your ears, ye virtuous ones: \u201cWhat I\nam NOT, that, that is God to me, and virtue!\u201d", "And others are there who go along heavily and creakingly, like carts\ntaking stones downhill: they talk much of dignity and virtue\u2014their drag\nthey call virtue!\n\nAnd others are there who are like eight-day clocks when wound up; they\ntick, and want people to call ticking\u2014virtue.\n\nVerily, in those have I mine amusement: wherever I find such clocks I\nshall wind them up with my mockery, and they shall even whirr thereby!", "And others are proud of their modicum of righteousness, and for the sake\nof it do violence to all things: so that the world is drowned in their\nunrighteousness.\n\nAh! how ineptly cometh the word \u201cvirtue\u201d out of their mouth! And when\nthey say: \u201cI am just,\u201d it always soundeth like: \u201cI am just\u2014revenged!\u201d\n\nWith their virtues they want to scratch out the eyes of their enemies;\nand they elevate themselves only that they may lower others.", "And again there are those who sit in their swamp, and speak thus from\namong the bulrushes: \u201cVirtue\u2014that is to sit quietly in the swamp.\n\nWe bite no one, and go out of the way of him who would bite; and in all\nmatters we have the opinion that is given us.\u201d\n\nAnd again there are those who love attitudes, and think that virtue is a\nsort of attitude.\n\nTheir knees continually adore, and their hands are eulogies of virtue,\nbut their heart knoweth naught thereof.", "And again there are those who regard it as virtue to say: \u201cVirtue\nis necessary\u201d; but after all they believe only that policemen are\nnecessary.\n\nAnd many a one who cannot see men\u2019s loftiness, calleth it virtue to see\ntheir baseness far too well: thus calleth he his evil eye virtue.\u2014\n\nAnd some want to be edified and raised up, and call it virtue: and\nothers want to be cast down,\u2014and likewise call it virtue.", "And thus do almost all think that they participate in virtue; and at\nleast every one claimeth to be an authority on \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil.\u201d\n\nBut Zarathustra came not to say unto all those liars and fools: \u201cWhat do\nYE know of virtue!

That YOUR very Self be in your action, as the mother is\nin the child: let that be YOUR formula of virtue!\n\nVerily, I have taken from you a hundred formulae and your virtue\u2019s\nfavourite playthings; and now ye upbraid me, as children upbraid.\n\nThey played by the sea\u2014then came there a wave and swept their\nplaythings into the deep: and now do they cry.", "But the same wave shall bring them new playthings, and spread before\nthem new speckled shells!\n\nThus will they be comforted; and like them shall ye also, my friends,\nhave your comforting\u2014and new speckled shells!\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII. THE RABBLE.\n\n\nLife is a well of delight; but where the rabble also drink, there all\nfountains are poisoned.\n\nTo everything cleanly am I well disposed; but I hate to see the grinning\nmouths and the thirst of the unclean.", "They cast their eye down into the fountain: and now glanceth up to me\ntheir odious smile out of the fountain.\n\nThe holy water have they poisoned with their lustfulness; and when they\ncalled their filthy dreams delight, then poisoned they also the words.\n\nIndignant becometh the flame when they put their damp hearts to the\nfire; the spirit itself bubbleth and smoketh when the rabble approach\nthe fire.", "Mawkish and over-mellow becometh the fruit in their hands: unsteady, and\nwithered at the top, doth their look make the fruit-tree.\n\nAnd many a one who hath turned away from life, hath only turned away\nfrom the rabble: he hated to share with them fountain, flame, and fruit.\n\nAnd many a one who hath gone into the wilderness and suffered thirst\nwith beasts of prey, disliked only to sit at the cistern with filthy\ncamel-drivers.", "And many a one who hath come along as a destroyer, and as a hailstorm\nto all cornfields, wanted merely to put his foot into the jaws of the\nrabble, and thus stop their throat.\n\nAnd it is not the mouthful which hath most choked me, to know that life\nitself requireth enmity and death and torture-crosses:\u2014\n\nBut I asked once, and suffocated almost with my question: What? is the\nrabble also NECESSARY for life?", "Are poisoned fountains necessary, and stinking fires, and filthy dreams,\nand maggots in the bread of life?\n\nNot my hatred, but my loathing, gnawed hungrily at my life! Ah, ofttimes\nbecame I weary of spirit, when I found even the rabble spiritual!\n\nAnd on the rulers turned I my back, when I saw what they now call\nruling: to traffic and bargain for power\u2014with the rabble!", "Amongst peoples of a strange language did I dwell, with stopped ears: so\nthat the language of their trafficking might remain strange unto me, and\ntheir bargaining for power.\n\nAnd holding my nose, I went morosely through all yesterdays and to-days:\nverily, badly smell all yesterdays and to-days of the scribbling rabble!\n\nLike a cripple become deaf, and blind, and dumb\u2014thus have I lived long;\nthat I might not live with the power-rabble, the scribe-rabble, and the\npleasure-rabble.", "Toilsomely did my spirit mount stairs, and cautiously; alms of delight\nwere its refreshment; on the staff did life creep along with the blind\none.\n\nWhat hath happened unto me? How have I freed myself from loathing?\nWho hath rejuvenated mine eye? How have I flown to the height where no\nrabble any longer sit at the wells?\n\nDid my loathing itself create for me wings and fountain-divining powers?\nVerily, to the loftiest height had I to fly, to find again the well of\ndelight!", "Oh, I have found it, my brethren! Here on the loftiest height bubbleth\nup for me the well of delight! And there is a life at whose waters none\nof the rabble drink with me!\n\nAlmost too violently dost thou flow for me, thou fountain of delight!\nAnd often emptiest thou the goblet again, in wanting to fill it!\n\nAnd yet must I learn to approach thee more modestly: far too violently\ndoth my heart still flow towards thee:\u2014", "My heart on which my summer burneth, my short, hot, melancholy,\nover-happy summer: how my summer heart longeth for thy coolness!\n\nPast, the lingering distress of my spring! Past, the wickedness of my\nsnowflakes in June! Summer have I become entirely, and summer-noontide!\n\nA summer on the loftiest height, with cold fountains and blissful\nstillness: oh, come, my friends, that the stillness may become more\nblissful!", "For this is OUR height and our home: too high and steep do we here dwell\nfor all uncleanly ones and their thirst.\n\nCast but your pure eyes into the well of my delight, my friends! How\ncould it become turbid thereby! It shall laugh back to you with ITS\npurity.\n\nOn the tree of the future build we our nest; eagles shall bring us lone\nones food in their beaks!\n\nVerily, no food of which the impure could be fellow-partakers! Fire,\nwould they think they devoured, and burn their mouths!", "Verily, no abodes do we here keep ready for the impure! An ice-cave to\ntheir bodies would our happiness be, and to their spirits!\n\nAnd as strong winds will we live above them, neighbours to the eagles,\nneighbours to the snow, neighbours to the sun: thus live the strong\nwinds.\n\nAnd like a wind will I one day blow amongst them, and with my spirit,\ntake the breath from their spirit: thus willeth my future.", "Verily, a strong wind is Zarathustra to all low places; and this counsel\ncounselleth he to his enemies, and to whatever spitteth and speweth:\n\u201cTake care not to spit AGAINST the wind!\u201d\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX. THE TARANTULAS.\n\n\nLo, this is the tarantula\u2019s den! Wouldst thou see the tarantula itself?\nHere hangeth its web: touch this, so that it may tremble.", "There cometh the tarantula willingly: Welcome, tarantula! Black on thy\nback is thy triangle and symbol; and I know also what is in thy soul.\n\nRevenge is in thy soul: wherever thou bitest, there ariseth black scab;\nwith revenge, thy poison maketh the soul giddy!\n\nThus do I speak unto you in parable, ye who make the soul giddy,\nye preachers of EQUALITY! Tarantulas are ye unto me, and secretly\nrevengeful ones!", "But I will soon bring your hiding-places to the light: therefore do I\nlaugh in your face my laughter of the height.\n\nTherefore do I tear at your web, that your rage may lure you out of your\nden of lies, and that your revenge may leap forth from behind your word\n\u201cjustice.\u201d\n\nBecause, FOR MAN TO BE REDEEMED FROM REVENGE\u2014that is for me the bridge\nto the highest hope, and a rainbow after long storms.", "Otherwise, however, would the tarantulas have it. \u201cLet it be\nvery justice for the world to become full of the storms of our\nvengeance\u201d\u2014thus do they talk to one another.\n\n\u201cVengeance will we use, and insult, against all who are not like\nus\u201d\u2014thus do the tarantula-hearts pledge themselves.\n\n\u201cAnd \u2018Will to Equality\u2019\u2014that itself shall henceforth be the name of\nvirtue; and against all that hath power will we raise an outcry!\u201d", "Ye preachers of equality, the tyrant-frenzy of impotence crieth thus in\nyou for \u201cequality\u201d: your most secret tyrant-longings disguise themselves\nthus in virtue-words!\n\nFretted conceit and suppressed envy\u2014perhaps your fathers\u2019 conceit and\nenvy: in you break they forth as flame and frenzy of vengeance.\n\nWhat the father hath hid cometh out in the son; and oft have I found in\nthe son the father\u2019s revealed secret.", "Inspired ones they resemble: but it is not the heart that inspireth\nthem\u2014but vengeance. And when they become subtle and cold, it is not\nspirit, but envy, that maketh them so.\n\nTheir jealousy leadeth them also into thinkers\u2019 paths; and this is the\nsign of their jealousy\u2014they always go too far: so that their fatigue\nhath at last to go to sleep on the snow.\n\nIn all their lamentations soundeth vengeance, in all their eulogies is\nmaleficence; and being judge seemeth to them bliss.", "But thus do I counsel you, my friends: distrust all in whom the impulse\nto punish is powerful!\n\nThey are people of bad race and lineage; out of their countenances peer\nthe hangman and the sleuth-hound.\n\nDistrust all those who talk much of their justice! Verily, in their\nsouls not only honey is lacking.\n\nAnd when they call themselves \u201cthe good and just,\u201d forget not, that for\nthem to be Pharisees, nothing is lacking but\u2014power!\n\nMy friends, I will not be mixed up and confounded with others.", "There are those who preach my doctrine of life, and are at the same time\npreachers of equality, and tarantulas.\n\nThat they speak in favour of life, though they sit in their den, these\npoison-spiders, and withdrawn from life\u2014is because they would thereby\ndo injury.\n\nTo those would they thereby do injury who have power at present: for\nwith those the preaching of death is still most at home.", "Were it otherwise, then would the tarantulas teach otherwise: and they\nthemselves were formerly the best world-maligners and heretic-burners.\n\nWith these preachers of equality will I not be mixed up and confounded.\nFor thus speaketh justice UNTO ME: \u201cMen are not equal.\u201d\n\nAnd neither shall they become so! What would be my love to the Superman,\nif I spake otherwise?", "On a thousand bridges and piers shall they throng to the future, and\nalways shall there be more war and inequality among them: thus doth my\ngreat love make me speak!\n\nInventors of figures and phantoms shall they be in their hostilities;\nand with those figures and phantoms shall they yet fight with each other\nthe supreme fight!\n\nGood and evil, and rich and poor, and high and low, and all names of\nvalues: weapons shall they be, and sounding signs, that life must again\nand again surpass itself!", "Aloft will it build itself with columns and stairs\u2014life itself: into\nremote distances would it gaze, and out towards blissful beauties\u2014\nTHEREFORE doth it require elevation!\n\nAnd because it requireth elevation, therefore doth it require steps, and\nvariance of steps and climbers! To rise striveth life, and in rising to\nsurpass itself.\n\nAnd just behold, my friends! Here where the tarantula\u2019s den is, riseth\naloft an ancient temple\u2019s ruins\u2014just behold it with enlightened eyes!", "Verily, he who here towered aloft his thoughts in stone, knew as well as\nthe wisest ones about the secret of life!\n\nThat there is struggle and inequality even in beauty, and war for power\nand supremacy: that doth he here teach us in the plainest parable.\n\nHow divinely do vault and arch here contrast in the struggle: how with\nlight and shade they strive against each other, the divinely striving\nones.\u2014", "Thus, steadfast and beautiful, let us also be enemies, my friends!\nDivinely will we strive AGAINST one another!\u2014\n\nAlas! There hath the tarantula bit me myself, mine old enemy! Divinely\nsteadfast and beautiful, it hath bit me on the finger!\n\n\u201cPunishment must there be, and justice\u201d\u2014so thinketh it: \u201cnot\ngratuitously shall he here sing songs in honour of enmity!\u201d\n\nYea, it hath revenged itself! And alas! now will it make my soul also\ndizzy with revenge!", "That I may NOT turn dizzy, however, bind me fast, my friends, to this\npillar! Rather will I be a pillar-saint than a whirl of vengeance!\n\nVerily, no cyclone or whirlwind is Zarathustra: and if he be a dancer,\nhe is not at all a tarantula-dancer!\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXXX. THE FAMOUS WISE ONES.\n\n\nThe people have ye served and the people\u2019s superstition\u2014NOT the\ntruth!\u2014all ye famous wise ones!

How would I suck at the breasts of\nlight!\n\nAnd you yourselves would I bless, ye twinkling starlets and glow-worms\naloft!\u2014and would rejoice in the gifts of your light.\n\nBut I live in mine own light, I drink again into myself the flames that\nbreak forth from me.\n\nI know not the happiness of the receiver; and oft have I dreamt that\nstealing must be more blessed than receiving.", "It is my poverty that my hand never ceaseth bestowing; it is mine envy\nthat I see waiting eyes and the brightened nights of longing.\n\nOh, the misery of all bestowers! Oh, the darkening of my sun! Oh, the\ncraving to crave! Oh, the violent hunger in satiety!\n\nThey take from me: but do I yet touch their soul? There is a gap \u2018twixt\ngiving and receiving; and the smallest gap hath finally to be bridged\nover.", "A hunger ariseth out of my beauty: I should like to injure those I\nillumine; I should like to rob those I have gifted:\u2014thus do I hunger\nfor wickedness.\n\nWithdrawing my hand when another hand already stretcheth out to it;\nhesitating like the cascade, which hesitateth even in its leap:\u2014thus do\nI hunger for wickedness!\n\nSuch revenge doth mine abundance think of: such mischief welleth out of\nmy lonesomeness.", "My happiness in bestowing died in bestowing; my virtue became weary of\nitself by its abundance!\n\nHe who ever bestoweth is in danger of losing his shame; to him who ever\ndispenseth, the hand and heart become callous by very dispensing.\n\nMine eye no longer overfloweth for the shame of suppliants; my hand hath\nbecome too hard for the trembling of filled hands.", "Whence have gone the tears of mine eye, and the down of my heart? Oh,\nthe lonesomeness of all bestowers! Oh, the silence of all shining ones!\n\nMany suns circle in desert space: to all that is dark do they speak with\ntheir light\u2014but to me they are silent.\n\nOh, this is the hostility of light to the shining one: unpityingly doth\nit pursue its course.\n\nUnfair to the shining one in its innermost heart, cold to the\nsuns:\u2014thus travelleth every sun.", "Like a storm do the suns pursue their courses: that is their travelling.\nTheir inexorable will do they follow: that is their coldness.\n\nOh, ye only is it, ye dark, nightly ones, that extract warmth from the\nshining ones! Oh, ye only drink milk and refreshment from the light\u2019s\nudders!\n\nAh, there is ice around me; my hand burneth with the iciness! Ah, there\nis thirst in me; it panteth after your thirst!\n\n\u2018Tis night: alas, that I have to be light! And thirst for the nightly!\nAnd lonesomeness!", "\u2018Tis night: now doth my longing break forth in me as a fountain,\u2014for\nspeech do I long.\n\n\u2018Tis night: now do all gushing fountains speak louder. And my soul also\nis a gushing fountain.\n\n\u2018Tis night: now do all songs of loving ones awake. And my soul also is\nthe song of a loving one.\u2014\n\nThus sang Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXXXII. THE DANCE-SONG.", "XXXII. THE DANCE-SONG.\n\n\nOne evening went Zarathustra and his disciples through the forest; and\nwhen he sought for a well, lo, he lighted upon a green meadow peacefully\nsurrounded with trees and bushes, where maidens were dancing together.\nAs soon as the maidens recognised Zarathustra, they ceased dancing;\nZarathustra, however, approached them with friendly mien and spake these\nwords:", "Cease not your dancing, ye lovely maidens! No game-spoiler hath come to\nyou with evil eye, no enemy of maidens.\n\nGod\u2019s advocate am I with the devil: he, however, is the spirit of\ngravity. How could I, ye light-footed ones, be hostile to divine dances?\nOr to maidens\u2019 feet with fine ankles?\n\nTo be sure, I am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but he who is not\nafraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses under my cypresses.", "And even the little God may he find, who is dearest to maidens: beside\nthe well lieth he quietly, with closed eyes.\n\nVerily, in broad daylight did he fall asleep, the sluggard! Had he\nperhaps chased butterflies too much?\n\nUpbraid me not, ye beautiful dancers, when I chasten the little God\nsomewhat! He will cry, certainly, and weep\u2014but he is laughable even\nwhen weeping!\n\nAnd with tears in his eyes shall he ask you for a dance; and I myself\nwill sing a song to his dance:", "A dance-song and satire on the spirit of gravity my supremest,\npowerfulest devil, who is said to be \u201clord of the world.\u201d\u2014\n\nAnd this is the song that Zarathustra sang when Cupid and the maidens\ndanced together:\n\nOf late did I gaze into thine eye, O Life! And into the unfathomable did\nI there seem to sink.\n\nBut thou pulledst me out with a golden angle; derisively didst thou\nlaugh when I called thee unfathomable.", "\u201cSuch is the language of all fish,\u201d saidst thou; \u201cwhat THEY do not\nfathom is unfathomable.\n\nBut changeable am I only, and wild, and altogether a woman, and no\nvirtuous one:\n\nThough I be called by you men the \u2018profound one,\u2019 or the \u2018faithful one,\u2019\n\u2018the eternal one,\u2019 \u2018the mysterious one.\u2019\n\nBut ye men endow us always with your own virtues\u2014alas, ye virtuous\nones!\u201d\n\nThus did she laugh, the unbelievable one; but never do I believe her and\nher laughter, when she speaketh evil of herself.", "And when I talked face to face with my wild Wisdom, she said to me\nangrily: \u201cThou willest, thou cravest, thou lovest; on that account alone\ndost thou PRAISE Life!\u201d\n\nThen had I almost answered indignantly and told the truth to the angry\none; and one cannot answer more indignantly than when one \u201ctelleth the\ntruth\u201d to one\u2019s Wisdom.\n\nFor thus do things stand with us three. In my heart do I love only\nLife\u2014and verily, most when I hate her!", "But that I am fond of Wisdom, and often too fond, is because she\nremindeth me very strongly of Life!\n\nShe hath her eye, her laugh, and even her golden angle-rod: am I\nresponsible for it that both are so alike?\n\nAnd when once Life asked me: \u201cWho is she then, this Wisdom?\u201d\u2014then said\nI eagerly: \u201cAh, yes! Wisdom!\n\nOne thirsteth for her and is not satisfied, one looketh through veils,\none graspeth through nets.\n\nIs she beautiful? What do I know! But the oldest carps are still lured\nby her.", "Changeable is she, and wayward; often have I seen her bite her lip, and\npass the comb against the grain of her hair.\n\nPerhaps she is wicked and false, and altogether a woman; but when she\nspeaketh ill of herself, just then doth she seduce most.\u201d\n\nWhen I had said this unto Life, then laughed she maliciously, and shut\nher eyes. \u201cOf whom dost thou speak?\u201d said she. \u201cPerhaps of me?\n\nAnd if thou wert right\u2014is it proper to say THAT in such wise to my\nface! But now, pray, speak also of thy Wisdom!\u201d", "Ah, and now hast thou again opened thine eyes, O beloved Life! And into\nthe unfathomable have I again seemed to sink.\u2014\n\nThus sang Zarathustra. But when the dance was over and the maidens had\ndeparted, he became sad.\n\n\u201cThe sun hath been long set,\u201d said he at last, \u201cthe meadow is damp, and\nfrom the forest cometh coolness.\n\nAn unknown presence is about me, and gazeth thoughtfully. What! Thou\nlivest still, Zarathustra?\n\nWhy? Wherefore? Whereby? Whither? Where? How? Is it not folly still to\nlive?\u2014", "Ah, my friends; the evening is it which thus interrogateth in me.\nForgive me my sadness!\n\nEvening hath come on: forgive me that evening hath come on!\u201d\n\nThus sang Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII. THE GRAVE-SONG.\n\n\n\u201cYonder is the grave-island, the silent isle; yonder also are the graves\nof my youth. Thither will I carry an evergreen wreath of life.\u201d\n\nResolving thus in my heart, did I sail o\u2019er the sea.\u2014", "Oh, ye sights and scenes of my youth! Oh, all ye gleams of love, ye\ndivine fleeting gleams! How could ye perish so soon for me! I think of\nyou to-day as my dead ones.\n\nFrom you, my dearest dead ones, cometh unto me a sweet savour,\nheart-opening and melting. Verily, it convulseth and openeth the heart\nof the lone seafarer.", "Still am I the richest and most to be envied\u2014I, the lonesomest one!\nFor I HAVE POSSESSED you, and ye possess me still. Tell me: to whom hath\nthere ever fallen such rosy apples from the tree as have fallen unto me?\n\nStill am I your love\u2019s heir and heritage, blooming to your memory with\nmany-hued, wild-growing virtues, O ye dearest ones!", "Ah, we were made to remain nigh unto each other, ye kindly strange\nmarvels; and not like timid birds did ye come to me and my longing\u2014nay,\nbut as trusting ones to a trusting one!\n\nYea, made for faithfulness, like me, and for fond eternities, must I now\nname you by your faithlessness, ye divine glances and fleeting gleams:\nno other name have I yet learnt.", "Verily, too early did ye die for me, ye fugitives. Yet did ye not flee\nfrom me, nor did I flee from you: innocent are we to each other in our\nfaithlessness.\n\nTo kill ME, did they strangle you, ye singing birds of my hopes! Yea, at\nyou, ye dearest ones, did malice ever shoot its arrows\u2014to hit my heart!\n\nAnd they hit it! Because ye were always my dearest, my possession and my\npossessedness: ON THAT ACCOUNT had ye to die young, and far too early!", "At my most vulnerable point did they shoot the arrow\u2014namely, at you,\nwhose skin is like down\u2014or more like the smile that dieth at a glance!\n\nBut this word will I say unto mine enemies: What is all manslaughter in\ncomparison with what ye have done unto me!\n\nWorse evil did ye do unto me than all manslaughter; the irretrievable\ndid ye take from me:\u2014thus do I speak unto you, mine enemies!", "Slew ye not my youth\u2019s visions and dearest marvels! My playmates took ye\nfrom me, the blessed spirits! To their memory do I deposit this wreath\nand this curse.\n\nThis curse upon you, mine enemies! Have ye not made mine eternal short,\nas a tone dieth away in a cold night! Scarcely, as the twinkle of divine\neyes, did it come to me\u2014as a fleeting gleam!\n\nThus spake once in a happy hour my purity: \u201cDivine shall everything be\nunto me.\u201d", "Then did ye haunt me with foul phantoms; ah, whither hath that happy\nhour now fled!\n\n\u201cAll days shall be holy unto me\u201d\u2014so spake once the wisdom of my youth:\nverily, the language of a joyous wisdom!\n\nBut then did ye enemies steal my nights, and sold them to sleepless\ntorture: ah, whither hath that joyous wisdom now fled?\n\nOnce did I long for happy auspices: then did ye lead an owl-monster\nacross my path, an adverse sign. Ah, whither did my tender longing then\nflee?", "All loathing did I once vow to renounce: then did ye change my nigh ones\nand nearest ones into ulcerations. Ah, whither did my noblest vow then\nflee?\n\nAs a blind one did I once walk in blessed ways: then did ye cast\nfilth on the blind one\u2019s course: and now is he disgusted with the old\nfootpath.\n\nAnd when I performed my hardest task, and celebrated the triumph of\nmy victories, then did ye make those who loved me call out that I then\ngrieved them most.", "Verily, it was always your doing: ye embittered to me my best honey, and\nthe diligence of my best bees.\n\nTo my charity have ye ever sent the most impudent beggars; around my\nsympathy have ye ever crowded the incurably shameless. Thus have ye\nwounded the faith of my virtue.\n\nAnd when I offered my holiest as a sacrifice, immediately did your\n\u201cpiety\u201d put its fatter gifts beside it: so that my holiest suffocated in\nthe fumes of your fat.", "And once did I want to dance as I had never yet danced: beyond all\nheavens did I want to dance. Then did ye seduce my favourite minstrel.\n\nAnd now hath he struck up an awful, melancholy air; alas, he tooted as a\nmournful horn to mine ear!\n\nMurderous minstrel, instrument of evil, most innocent instrument!\nAlready did I stand prepared for the best dance: then didst thou slay my\nrapture with thy tones!", "Only in the dance do I know how to speak the parable of the highest\nthings:\u2014and now hath my grandest parable remained unspoken in my limbs!\n\nUnspoken and unrealised hath my highest hope remained! And there have\nperished for me all the visions and consolations of my youth!\n\nHow did I ever bear it? How did I survive and surmount such wounds? How\ndid my soul rise again out of those sepulchres?", "Yea, something invulnerable, unburiable is with me, something that would\nrend rocks asunder: it is called MY WILL. Silently doth it proceed, and\nunchanged throughout the years.\n\nIts course will it go upon my feet, mine old Will; hard of heart is its\nnature and invulnerable.\n\nInvulnerable am I only in my heel. Ever livest thou there, and art like\nthyself, thou most patient one! Ever hast thou burst all shackles of the\ntomb!", "In thee still liveth also the unrealisedness of my youth; and as life\nand youth sittest thou here hopeful on the yellow ruins of graves.\n\nYea, thou art still for me the demolisher of all graves: Hail to thee,\nmy Will! And only where there are graves are there resurrections.\u2014\n\nThus sang Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV. SELF-SURPASSING.\n\n\n\u201cWill to Truth\u201d do ye call it, ye wisest ones, that which impelleth you\nand maketh you ardent?\n\nWill for the thinkableness of all being: thus do _I_ call your will!", "All being would ye MAKE thinkable: for ye doubt with good reason whether\nit be already thinkable.\n\nBut it shall accommodate and bend itself to you! So willeth your will.\nSmooth shall it become and subject to the spirit, as its mirror and\nreflection.\n\nThat is your entire will, ye wisest ones, as a Will to Power; and even\nwhen ye speak of good and evil, and of estimates of value.\n\nYe would still create a world before which ye can bow the knee: such is\nyour ultimate hope and ecstasy.", "The ignorant, to be sure, the people\u2014they are like a river on which a\nboat floateth along: and in the boat sit the estimates of value, solemn\nand disguised.\n\nYour will and your valuations have ye put on the river of becoming; it\nbetrayeth unto me an old Will to Power, what is believed by the people\nas good and evil.\n\nIt was ye, ye wisest ones, who put such guests in this boat, and gave\nthem pomp and proud names\u2014ye and your ruling Will!", "Onward the river now carrieth your boat: it MUST carry it. A small\nmatter if the rough wave foameth and angrily resisteth its keel!\n\nIt is not the river that is your danger and the end of your good and\nevil, ye wisest ones: but that Will itself, the Will to Power\u2014the\nunexhausted, procreating life-will.\n\nBut that ye may understand my gospel of good and evil, for that purpose\nwill I tell you my gospel of life, and of the nature of all living\nthings.", "The living thing did I follow; I walked in the broadest and narrowest\npaths to learn its nature.\n\nWith a hundred-faced mirror did I catch its glance when its mouth was\nshut, so that its eye might speak unto me. And its eye spake unto me.\n\nBut wherever I found living things, there heard I also the language of\nobedience. All living things are obeying things.\n\nAnd this heard I secondly: Whatever cannot obey itself, is commanded.\nSuch is the nature of living things.", "This, however, is the third thing which I heard\u2014namely, that commanding\nis more difficult than obeying. And not only because the commander\nbeareth the burden of all obeyers, and because this burden readily\ncrusheth him:\u2014\n\nAn attempt and a risk seemed all commanding unto me; and whenever it\ncommandeth, the living thing risketh itself thereby.\n\nYea, even when it commandeth itself, then also must it atone for its\ncommanding. Of its own law must it become the judge and avenger and\nvictim.", "How doth this happen! so did I ask myself. What persuadeth the living\nthing to obey, and command, and even be obedient in commanding?\n\nHearken now unto my word, ye wisest ones! Test it seriously, whether\nI have crept into the heart of life itself, and into the roots of its\nheart!\n\nWherever I found a living thing, there found I Will to Power; and even\nin the will of the servant found I the will to be master.", "That to the stronger the weaker shall serve\u2014thereto persuadeth he his\nwill who would be master over a still weaker one. That delight alone he\nis unwilling to forego.\n\nAnd as the lesser surrendereth himself to the greater that he may have\ndelight and power over the least of all, so doth even the greatest\nsurrender himself, and staketh\u2014life, for the sake of power.\n\nIt is the surrender of the greatest to run risk and danger, and play\ndice for death.", "And where there is sacrifice and service and love-glances, there also\nis the will to be master. By by-ways doth the weaker then slink into\nthe fortress, and into the heart of the mightier one\u2014and there stealeth\npower.\n\nAnd this secret spake Life herself unto me. \u201cBehold,\u201d said she, \u201cI am\nthat WHICH MUST EVER SURPASS ITSELF.\n\nTo be sure, ye call it will to procreation, or impulse towards a goal,\ntowards the higher, remoter, more manifold: but all that is one and the\nsame secret.", "Rather would I succumb than disown this one thing; and verily, where\nthere is succumbing and leaf-falling, lo, there doth Life sacrifice\nitself\u2014for power!\n\nThat I have to be struggle, and becoming, and purpose, and\ncross-purpose\u2014ah, he who divineth my will, divineth well also on what\nCROOKED paths it hath to tread!\n\nWhatever I create, and however much I love it,\u2014soon must I be adverse\nto it, and to my love: so willeth my will.", "And even thou, discerning one, art only a path and footstep of my will:\nverily, my Will to Power walketh even on the feet of thy Will to Truth!\n\nHe certainly did not hit the truth who shot at it the formula: \u2018Will to\nexistence\u2019: that will\u2014doth not exist!\n\nFor what is not, cannot will; that, however, which is in existence\u2014how\ncould it still strive for existence!\n\nOnly where there is life, is there also will: not, however, Will to\nLife, but\u2014so teach I thee\u2014Will to Power!", "Much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one; but out of\nthe very reckoning speaketh\u2014the Will to Power!\u201d\u2014\n\nThus did Life once teach me: and thereby, ye wisest ones, do I solve you\nthe riddle of your hearts.\n\nVerily, I say unto you: good and evil which would be everlasting\u2014it\ndoth not exist! Of its own accord must it ever surpass itself anew.", "With your values and formulae of good and evil, ye exercise power,\nye valuing ones: and that is your secret love, and the sparkling,\ntrembling, and overflowing of your souls.\n\nBut a stronger power groweth out of your values, and a new surpassing:\nby it breaketh egg and egg-shell.\n\nAnd he who hath to be a creator in good and evil\u2014verily, he hath first\nto be a destroyer, and break values in pieces.\n\nThus doth the greatest evil pertain to the greatest good: that, however,\nis the creating good.\u2014", "Let us SPEAK thereof, ye wisest ones, even though it be bad. To be\nsilent is worse; all suppressed truths become poisonous.\n\nAnd let everything break up which\u2014can break up by our truths! Many a\nhouse is still to be built!\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXXXV. THE SUBLIME ONES.\n\n\nCalm is the bottom of my sea: who would guess that it hideth droll\nmonsters!\n\nUnmoved is my depth: but it sparkleth with swimming enigmas and\nlaughters.", "A sublime one saw I to-day, a solemn one, a penitent of the spirit: Oh,\nhow my soul laughed at his ugliness!\n\nWith upraised breast, and like those who draw in their breath: thus did\nhe stand, the sublime one, and in silence:\n\nO\u2019erhung with ugly truths, the spoil of his hunting, and rich in torn\nraiment; many thorns also hung on him\u2014but I saw no rose.\n\nNot yet had he learned laughing and beauty. Gloomy did this hunter\nreturn from the forest of knowledge.", "From the fight with wild beasts returned he home: but even yet a wild\nbeast gazeth out of his seriousness\u2014an unconquered wild beast!\n\nAs a tiger doth he ever stand, on the point of springing; but I do not\nlike those strained souls; ungracious is my taste towards all those\nself-engrossed ones.\n\nAnd ye tell me, friends, that there is to be no dispute about taste and\ntasting? But all life is a dispute about taste and tasting!", "Taste: that is weight at the same time, and scales and weigher; and alas\nfor every living thing that would live without dispute about weight and\nscales and weigher!\n\nShould he become weary of his sublimeness, this sublime one, then only\nwill his beauty begin\u2014and then only will I taste him and find him\nsavoury.\n\nAnd only when he turneth away from himself will he o\u2019erleap his own\nshadow\u2014and verily! into HIS sun.", "Far too long did he sit in the shade; the cheeks of the penitent of the\nspirit became pale; he almost starved on his expectations.\n\nContempt is still in his eye, and loathing hideth in his mouth. To be\nsure, he now resteth, but he hath not yet taken rest in the sunshine.\n\nAs the ox ought he to do; and his happiness should smell of the earth,\nand not of contempt for the earth.", "As a white ox would I like to see him, which, snorting and lowing,\nwalketh before the ploughshare: and his lowing should also laud all\nthat is earthly!\n\nDark is still his countenance; the shadow of his hand danceth upon it.\nO\u2019ershadowed is still the sense of his eye.\n\nHis deed itself is still the shadow upon him: his doing obscureth the\ndoer. Not yet hath he overcome his deed.\n\nTo be sure, I love in him the shoulders of the ox: but now do I want to\nsee also the eye of the angel.", "Also his hero-will hath he still to unlearn: an exalted one shall he\nbe, and not only a sublime one:\u2014the ether itself should raise him, the\nwill-less one!\n\nHe hath subdued monsters, he hath solved enigmas. But he should also\nredeem his monsters and enigmas; into heavenly children should he\ntransform them.\n\nAs yet hath his knowledge not learned to smile, and to be without\njealousy; as yet hath his gushing passion not become calm in beauty.", "Verily, not in satiety shall his longing cease and disappear, but in\nbeauty! Gracefulness belongeth to the munificence of the magnanimous.\n\nHis arm across his head: thus should the hero repose; thus should he\nalso surmount his repose.\n\nBut precisely to the hero is BEAUTY the hardest thing of all.\nUnattainable is beauty by all ardent wills.\n\nA little more, a little less: precisely this is much here, it is the\nmost here.", "To stand with relaxed muscles and with unharnessed will: that is the\nhardest for all of you, ye sublime ones!\n\nWhen power becometh gracious and descendeth into the visible\u2014I call\nsuch condescension, beauty.\n\nAnd from no one do I want beauty so much as from thee, thou powerful\none: let thy goodness be thy last self-conquest.\n\nAll evil do I accredit to thee: therefore do I desire of thee the good.", "Verily, I have often laughed at the weaklings, who think themselves good\nbecause they have crippled paws!\n\nThe virtue of the pillar shalt thou strive after: more beautiful doth\nit ever become, and more graceful\u2014but internally harder and more\nsustaining\u2014the higher it riseth.\n\nYea, thou sublime one, one day shalt thou also be beautiful, and hold up\nthe mirror to thine own beauty.\n\nThen will thy soul thrill with divine desires; and there will be\nadoration even in thy vanity!", "For this is the secret of the soul: when the hero hath abandoned it,\nthen only approacheth it in dreams\u2014the superhero.\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI. THE LAND OF CULTURE.\n\n\nToo far did I fly into the future: a horror seized upon me.\n\nAnd when I looked around me, lo! there time was my sole contemporary.\n\nThen did I fly backwards, homewards\u2014and always faster. Thus did I come\nunto you, ye present-day men, and into the land of culture.", "For the first time brought I an eye to see you, and good desire: verily,\nwith longing in my heart did I come.\n\nBut how did it turn out with me? Although so alarmed\u2014I had yet to\nlaugh! Never did mine eye see anything so motley-coloured!\n\nI laughed and laughed, while my foot still trembled, and my heart as\nwell. \u201cHere forsooth, is the home of all the paintpots,\u201d\u2014said I.\n\nWith fifty patches painted on faces and limbs\u2014so sat ye there to mine\nastonishment, ye present-day men!", "And with fifty mirrors around you, which flattered your play of colours,\nand repeated it!\n\nVerily, ye could wear no better masks, ye present-day men, than your own\nfaces! Who could\u2014RECOGNISE you!\n\nWritten all over with the characters of the past, and these characters\nalso pencilled over with new characters\u2014thus have ye concealed\nyourselves well from all decipherers!", "And though one be a trier of the reins, who still believeth that ye have\nreins! Out of colours ye seem to be baked, and out of glued scraps.\n\nAll times and peoples gaze divers-coloured out of your veils; all\ncustoms and beliefs speak divers-coloured out of your gestures.\n\nHe who would strip you of veils and wrappers, and paints and gestures,\nwould just have enough left to scare the crows.", "Verily, I myself am the scared crow that once saw you naked, and without\npaint; and I flew away when the skeleton ogled at me.\n\nRather would I be a day-labourer in the nether-world, and among the\nshades of the bygone!\u2014Fatter and fuller than ye, are forsooth the\nnether-worldlings!\n\nThis, yea this, is bitterness to my bowels, that I can neither endure\nyou naked nor clothed, ye present-day men!", "All that is unhomelike in the future, and whatever maketh strayed birds\nshiver, is verily more homelike and familiar than your \u201creality.\u201d\n\nFor thus speak ye: \u201cReal are we wholly, and without faith and\nsuperstition\u201d: thus do ye plume yourselves\u2014alas! even without plumes!\n\nIndeed, how would ye be ABLE to believe, ye divers-coloured ones!\u2014ye\nwho are pictures of all that hath ever been believed!", "Perambulating refutations are ye, of belief itself, and a dislocation of\nall thought. UNTRUSTWORTHY ONES: thus do _I_ call you, ye real ones!\n\nAll periods prate against one another in your spirits; and the dreams\nand pratings of all periods were even realer than your awakeness!\n\nUnfruitful are ye: THEREFORE do ye lack belief. But he who had to\ncreate, had always his presaging dreams and astral premonitions\u2014and\nbelieved in believing!\u2014", "Half-open doors are ye, at which grave-diggers wait. And this is YOUR\nreality: \u201cEverything deserveth to perish.\u201d\n\nAlas, how ye stand there before me, ye unfruitful ones; how lean your\nribs! And many of you surely have had knowledge thereof.\n\nMany a one hath said: \u201cThere hath surely a God filched something from\nme secretly whilst I slept? Verily, enough to make a girl for himself\ntherefrom!\n\n\u201cAmazing is the poverty of my ribs!\u201d thus hath spoken many a present-day\nman.", "Yea, ye are laughable unto me, ye present-day men! And especially when\nye marvel at yourselves!\n\nAnd woe unto me if I could not laugh at your marvelling, and had to\nswallow all that is repugnant in your platters!\n\nAs it is, however, I will make lighter of you, since I have to carry\n_what is heavy;_ and what matter if beetles and May-bugs also alight on\nmy load!\n\nVerily, it shall not on that account become heavier to me! And not from\nyou, ye present-day men, shall my great weariness arise.\u2014", "Ah, whither shall I now ascend with my longing! From all mountains do I\nlook out for fatherlands and motherlands.\n\nBut a home have I found nowhere: unsettled am I in all cities, and\ndecamping at all gates.\n\nAlien to me, and a mockery, are the present-day men, to whom of late my\nheart impelled me; and exiled am I from fatherlands and motherlands.\n\nThus do I love only my CHILDREN\u2019S LAND, the undiscovered in the remotest\nsea: for it do I bid my sails search and search.", "Unto my children will I make amends for being the child of my fathers:\nand unto all the future\u2014for THIS present-day!\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII. IMMACULATE PERCEPTION.\n\n\nWhen yester-eve the moon arose, then did I fancy it about to bear a sun:\nso broad and teeming did it lie on the horizon.\n\nBut it was a liar with its pregnancy; and sooner will I believe in the\nman in the moon than in the woman.", "To be sure, little of a man is he also, that timid night-reveller.\nVerily, with a bad conscience doth he stalk over the roofs.\n\nFor he is covetous and jealous, the monk in the moon; covetous of the\nearth, and all the joys of lovers.\n\nNay, I like him not, that tom-cat on the roofs! Hateful unto me are all\nthat slink around half-closed windows!\n\nPiously and silently doth he stalk along on the star-carpets:\u2014but I\nlike no light-treading human feet, on which not even a spur jingleth.", "Every honest one\u2019s step speaketh; the cat however, stealeth along over\nthe ground. Lo! cat-like doth the moon come along, and dishonestly.\u2014\n\nThis parable speak I unto you sentimental dissemblers, unto you, the\n\u201cpure discerners!\u201d You do _I_ call\u2014covetous ones!\n\nAlso ye love the earth, and the earthly: I have divined you well!\u2014but\nshame is in your love, and a bad conscience\u2014ye are like the moon!", "To despise the earthly hath your spirit been persuaded, but not your\nbowels: these, however, are the strongest in you!\n\nAnd now is your spirit ashamed to be at the service of your bowels, and\ngoeth by-ways and lying ways to escape its own shame.\n\n\u201cThat would be the highest thing for me\u201d\u2014so saith your lying spirit\nunto itself\u2014\u201cto gaze upon life without desire, and not like the dog,\nwith hanging-out tongue:", "To be happy in gazing: with dead will, free from the grip and greed\nof selfishness\u2014cold and ashy-grey all over, but with intoxicated\nmoon-eyes!\n\nThat would be the dearest thing to me\u201d\u2014thus doth the seduced one seduce\nhimself,\u2014\u201cto love the earth as the moon loveth it, and with the eye\nonly to feel its beauty.\n\nAnd this do I call IMMACULATE perception of all things: to want nothing\nelse from them, but to be allowed to lie before them as a mirror with a\nhundred facets.\u201d\u2014", "Oh, ye sentimental dissemblers, ye covetous ones! Ye lack innocence in\nyour desire: and now do ye defame desiring on that account!\n\nVerily, not as creators, as procreators, or as jubilators do ye love the\nearth!\n\nWhere is innocence? Where there is will to procreation. And he who\nseeketh to create beyond himself, hath for me the purest will.\n\nWhere is beauty? Where I MUST WILL with my whole Will; where I will love\nand perish, that an image may not remain merely an image.", "Loving and perishing: these have rhymed from eternity. Will to love:\nthat is to be ready also for death. Thus do I speak unto you cowards!\n\nBut now doth your emasculated ogling profess to be \u201ccontemplation!\u201d\n And that which can be examined with cowardly eyes is to be christened\n\u201cbeautiful!\u201d Oh, ye violators of noble names!\n\nBut it shall be your curse, ye immaculate ones, ye pure discerners, that\nye shall never bring forth, even though ye lie broad and teeming on the\nhorizon!", "Verily, ye fill your mouth with noble words: and we are to believe that\nyour heart overfloweth, ye cozeners?\n\nBut MY words are poor, contemptible, stammering words: gladly do I pick\nup what falleth from the table at your repasts.\n\nYet still can I say therewith the truth\u2014to dissemblers! Yea, my\nfish-bones, shells, and prickly leaves shall\u2014tickle the noses of\ndissemblers!\n\nBad air is always about you and your repasts: your lascivious thoughts,\nyour lies, and secrets are indeed in the air!", "Dare only to believe in yourselves\u2014in yourselves and in your inward\nparts! He who doth not believe in himself always lieth.\n\nA God\u2019s mask have ye hung in front of you, ye \u201cpure ones\u201d: into a God\u2019s\nmask hath your execrable coiling snake crawled.\n\nVerily ye deceive, ye \u201ccontemplative ones!\u201d Even Zarathustra was once\nthe dupe of your godlike exterior; he did not divine the serpent\u2019s coil\nwith which it was stuffed.", "A God\u2019s soul, I once thought I saw playing in your games, ye pure\ndiscerners! No better arts did I once dream of than your arts!\n\nSerpents\u2019 filth and evil odour, the distance concealed from me: and that\na lizard\u2019s craft prowled thereabouts lasciviously.\n\nBut I came NIGH unto you: then came to me the day,\u2014and now cometh it to\nyou,\u2014at an end is the moon\u2019s love affair!\n\nSee there! Surprised and pale doth it stand\u2014before the rosy dawn!", "For already she cometh, the glowing one,\u2014HER love to the earth cometh!\nInnocence and creative desire, is all solar love!\n\nSee there, how she cometh impatiently over the sea! Do ye not feel the\nthirst and the hot breath of her love?\n\nAt the sea would she suck, and drink its depths to her height: now\nriseth the desire of the sea with its thousand breasts.\n\nKissed and sucked WOULD it be by the thirst of the sun; vapour WOULD it\nbecome, and height, and path of light, and light itself!", "Verily, like the sun do I love life, and all deep seas.\n\nAnd this meaneth TO ME knowledge: all that is deep shall ascend\u2014to my\nheight!\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII. SCHOLARS.\n\n\nWhen I lay asleep, then did a sheep eat at the ivy-wreath on my\nhead,\u2014it ate, and said thereby: \u201cZarathustra is no longer a scholar.\u201d\n\nIt said this, and went away clumsily and proudly. A child told it to me.\n\nI like to lie here where the children play, beside the ruined wall,\namong thistles and red poppies.", "A scholar am I still to the children, and also to the thistles and red\npoppies. Innocent are they, even in their wickedness.\n\nBut to the sheep I am no longer a scholar: so willeth my lot\u2014blessings\nupon it!\n\nFor this is the truth: I have departed from the house of the scholars,\nand the door have I also slammed behind me.\n\nToo long did my soul sit hungry at their table: not like them have I got\nthe knack of investigating, as the knack of nut-cracking.", "Freedom do I love, and the air over fresh soil; rather would I sleep on\nox-skins than on their honours and dignities.\n\nI am too hot and scorched with mine own thought: often is it ready to\ntake away my breath. Then have I to go into the open air, and away from\nall dusty rooms.\n\nBut they sit cool in the cool shade: they want in everything to be\nmerely spectators, and they avoid sitting where the sun burneth on the\nsteps.", "Like those who stand in the street and gape at the passers-by: thus do\nthey also wait, and gape at the thoughts which others have thought.\n\nShould one lay hold of them, then do they raise a dust like flour-sacks,\nand involuntarily: but who would divine that their dust came from corn,\nand from the yellow delight of the summer fields?", "When they give themselves out as wise, then do their petty sayings and\ntruths chill me: in their wisdom there is often an odour as if it came\nfrom the swamp; and verily, I have even heard the frog croak in it!\n\nClever are they\u2014they have dexterous fingers: what doth MY simplicity\npretend to beside their multiplicity! All threading and knitting and\nweaving do their fingers understand: thus do they make the hose of the\nspirit!", "Good clockworks are they: only be careful to wind them up properly!\nThen do they indicate the hour without mistake, and make a modest noise\nthereby.\n\nLike millstones do they work, and like pestles: throw only seed-corn\nunto them!\u2014they know well how to grind corn small, and make white dust\nout of it.\n\nThey keep a sharp eye on one another, and do not trust each other the\nbest. Ingenious in little artifices, they wait for those whose knowledge\nwalketh on lame feet,\u2014like spiders do they wait.", "I saw them always prepare their poison with precaution; and always did\nthey put glass gloves on their fingers in doing so.\n\nThey also know how to play with false dice; and so eagerly did I find\nthem playing, that they perspired thereby.\n\nWe are alien to each other, and their virtues are even more repugnant to\nmy taste than their falsehoods and false dice.\n\nAnd when I lived with them, then did I live above them. Therefore did\nthey take a dislike to me.", "They want to hear nothing of any one walking above their heads; and so\nthey put wood and earth and rubbish betwixt me and their heads.\n\nThus did they deafen the sound of my tread: and least have I hitherto\nbeen heard by the most learned.\n\nAll mankind\u2019s faults and weaknesses did they put betwixt themselves and\nme:\u2014they call it \u201cfalse ceiling\u201d in their houses.", "But nevertheless I walk with my thoughts ABOVE their heads; and even\nshould I walk on mine own errors, still would I be above them and their\nheads.\n\nFor men are NOT equal: so speaketh justice. And what I will, THEY may\nnot will!\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX. POETS.\n\n\n\u201cSince I have known the body better\u201d\u2014said Zarathustra to one of his\ndisciples\u2014\u201cthe spirit hath only been to me symbolically spirit; and all\nthe \u2018imperishable\u2019\u2014that is also but a simile.\u201d", "\u201cSo have I heard thee say once before,\u201d answered the disciple, \u201cand then\nthou addedst: \u2018But the poets lie too much.\u2019 Why didst thou say that the\npoets lie too much?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Zarathustra. \u201cThou askest why? I do not belong to those who\nmay be asked after their Why.\n\nIs my experience but of yesterday? It is long ago that I experienced the\nreasons for mine opinions.\n\nShould I not have to be a cask of memory, if I also wanted to have my\nreasons with me?", "It is already too much for me even to retain mine opinions; and many a\nbird flieth away.\n\nAnd sometimes, also, do I find a fugitive creature in my dovecote, which\nis alien to me, and trembleth when I lay my hand upon it.\n\nBut what did Zarathustra once say unto thee? That the poets lie too\nmuch?\u2014But Zarathustra also is a poet.\n\nBelievest thou that he there spake the truth? Why dost thou believe it?\u201d\n\nThe disciple answered: \u201cI believe in Zarathustra.\u201d But Zarathustra shook\nhis head and smiled.\u2014", "Belief doth not sanctify me, said he, least of all the belief in myself.\n\nBut granting that some one did say in all seriousness that the poets lie\ntoo much: he was right\u2014WE do lie too much.\n\nWe also know too little, and are bad learners: so we are obliged to lie.\n\nAnd which of us poets hath not adulterated his wine? Many a poisonous\nhotchpotch hath evolved in our cellars: many an indescribable thing hath\nthere been done.", "And because we know little, therefore are we pleased from the heart with\nthe poor in spirit, especially when they are young women!\n\nAnd even of those things are we desirous, which old women tell one\nanother in the evening. This do we call the eternally feminine in us.\n\nAnd as if there were a special secret access to knowledge, which CHOKETH\nUP for those who learn anything, so do we believe in the people and in\ntheir \u201cwisdom.\u201d", "This, however, do all poets believe: that whoever pricketh up his ears\nwhen lying in the grass or on lonely slopes, learneth something of the\nthings that are betwixt heaven and earth.\n\nAnd if there come unto them tender emotions, then do the poets always\nthink that nature herself is in love with them:\n\nAnd that she stealeth to their ear to whisper secrets into it, and\namorous flatteries: of this do they plume and pride themselves, before\nall mortals!", "Ah, there are so many things betwixt heaven and earth of which only the\npoets have dreamed!\n\nAnd especially ABOVE the heavens: for all Gods are poet-symbolisations,\npoet-sophistications!\n\nVerily, ever are we drawn aloft\u2014that is, to the realm of the clouds:\non these do we set our gaudy puppets, and then call them Gods and\nSupermen:\u2014\n\nAre not they light enough for those chairs!\u2014all these Gods and\nSupermen?\u2014", "Ah, how I am weary of all the inadequate that is insisted on as actual!\nAh, how I am weary of the poets!\n\nWhen Zarathustra so spake, his disciple resented it, but was silent. And\nZarathustra also was silent; and his eye directed itself inwardly, as if\nit gazed into the far distance. At last he sighed and drew breath.\u2014\n\nI am of to-day and heretofore, said he thereupon; but something is in me\nthat is of the morrow, and the day following, and the hereafter.", "I became weary of the poets, of the old and of the new: superficial are\nthey all unto me, and shallow seas.\n\nThey did not think sufficiently into the depth; therefore their feeling\ndid not reach to the bottom.\n\nSome sensation of voluptuousness and some sensation of tedium: these\nhave as yet been their best contemplation.\n\nGhost-breathing and ghost-whisking, seemeth to me all the\njingle-jangling of their harps; what have they known hitherto of the\nfervour of tones!\u2014", "They are also not pure enough for me: they all muddle their water that\nit may seem deep.\n\nAnd fain would they thereby prove themselves reconcilers: but mediaries\nand mixers are they unto me, and half-and-half, and impure!\u2014\n\nAh, I cast indeed my net into their sea, and meant to catch good fish;\nbut always did I draw up the head of some ancient God.\n\nThus did the sea give a stone to the hungry one. And they themselves may\nwell originate from the sea.", "Certainly, one findeth pearls in them: thereby they are the more like\nhard molluscs. And instead of a soul, I have often found in them salt\nslime.\n\nThey have learned from the sea also its vanity: is not the sea the\npeacock of peacocks?\n\nEven before the ugliest of all buffaloes doth it spread out its tail;\nnever doth it tire of its lace-fan of silver and silk.", "Disdainfully doth the buffalo glance thereat, nigh to the sand with its\nsoul, nigher still to the thicket, nighest, however, to the swamp.\n\nWhat is beauty and sea and peacock-splendour to it! This parable I speak\nunto the poets.\n\nVerily, their spirit itself is the peacock of peacocks, and a sea of\nvanity!\n\nSpectators, seeketh the spirit of the poet\u2014should they even be\nbuffaloes!\u2014\n\nBut of this spirit became I weary; and I see the time coming when it\nwill become weary of itself.", "Yea, changed have I seen the poets, and their glance turned towards\nthemselves.\n\nPenitents of the spirit have I seen appearing; they grew out of the\npoets.\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXL. GREAT EVENTS.", "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXL. GREAT EVENTS.\n\n\nThere is an isle in the sea\u2014not far from the Happy Isles of\nZarathustra\u2014on which a volcano ever smoketh; of which isle the people,\nand especially the old women amongst them, say that it is placed as a\nrock before the gate of the nether-world; but that through the volcano\nitself the narrow way leadeth downwards which conducteth to this gate.", "Now about the time that Zarathustra sojourned on the Happy Isles, it\nhappened that a ship anchored at the isle on which standeth the smoking\nmountain, and the crew went ashore to shoot rabbits. About the noontide\nhour, however, when the captain and his men were together again, they\nsaw suddenly a man coming towards them through the air, and a voice said\ndistinctly: \u201cIt is time! It is the highest time!\u201d But when the figure\nwas nearest to them (it flew past quickly, however, like a shadow, in", "the direction of the volcano), then did they recognise with the greatest\nsurprise that it was Zarathustra; for they had all seen him before\nexcept the captain himself, and they loved him as the people love: in\nsuch wise that love and awe were combined in equal degree.", "\u201cBehold!\u201d said the old helmsman, \u201cthere goeth Zarathustra to hell!\u201d\n\nAbout the same time that these sailors landed on the fire-isle, there\nwas a rumour that Zarathustra had disappeared; and when his friends were\nasked about it, they said that he had gone on board a ship by night,\nwithout saying whither he was going.", "Thus there arose some uneasiness. After three days, however, there came\nthe story of the ship\u2019s crew in addition to this uneasiness\u2014and\nthen did all the people say that the devil had taken Zarathustra. His\ndisciples laughed, sure enough, at this talk; and one of them said even:\n\u201cSooner would I believe that Zarathustra hath taken the devil.\u201d But at\nthe bottom of their hearts they were all full of anxiety and longing: so\ntheir joy was great when on the fifth day Zarathustra appeared amongst", "them.", "And this is the account of Zarathustra\u2019s interview with the fire-dog:\n\nThe earth, said he, hath a skin; and this skin hath diseases. One of\nthese diseases, for example, is called \u201cman.\u201d\n\nAnd another of these diseases is called \u201cthe fire-dog\u201d: concerning HIM\nmen have greatly deceived themselves, and let themselves be deceived.\n\nTo fathom this mystery did I go o\u2019er the sea; and I have seen the truth\nnaked, verily! barefooted up to the neck.", "Now do I know how it is concerning the fire-dog; and likewise concerning\nall the spouting and subversive devils, of which not only old women are\nafraid.\n\n\u201cUp with thee, fire-dog, out of thy depth!\u201d cried I, \u201cand confess how\ndeep that depth is! Whence cometh that which thou snortest up?\n\nThou drinkest copiously at the sea: that doth thine embittered eloquence\nbetray! In sooth, for a dog of the depth, thou takest thy nourishment\ntoo much from the surface!", "At the most, I regard thee as the ventriloquist of the earth: and ever,\nwhen I have heard subversive and spouting devils speak, I have found\nthem like thee: embittered, mendacious, and shallow.\n\nYe understand how to roar and obscure with ashes! Ye are the best\nbraggarts, and have sufficiently learned the art of making dregs boil.\n\nWhere ye are, there must always be dregs at hand, and much that is\nspongy, hollow, and compressed: it wanteth to have freedom.", "\u2018Freedom\u2019 ye all roar most eagerly: but I have unlearned the belief in\n\u2018great events,\u2019 when there is much roaring and smoke about them.\n\nAnd believe me, friend Hullabaloo! The greatest events\u2014are not our\nnoisiest, but our stillest hours.\n\nNot around the inventors of new noise, but around the inventors of new\nvalues, doth the world revolve; INAUDIBLY it revolveth.", "And just own to it! Little had ever taken place when thy noise and smoke\npassed away. What, if a city did become a mummy, and a statue lay in the\nmud!\n\nAnd this do I say also to the o\u2019erthrowers of statues: It is certainly\nthe greatest folly to throw salt into the sea, and statues into the mud.\n\nIn the mud of your contempt lay the statue: but it is just its law, that\nout of contempt, its life and living beauty grow again!", "With diviner features doth it now arise, seducing by its suffering; and\nverily! it will yet thank you for o\u2019erthrowing it, ye subverters!\n\nThis counsel, however, do I counsel to kings and churches, and to all\nthat is weak with age or virtue\u2014let yourselves be o\u2019erthrown! That ye\nmay again come to life, and that virtue\u2014may come to you!\u2014\u201d\n\nThus spake I before the fire-dog: then did he interrupt me sullenly, and\nasked: \u201cChurch? What is that?\u201d", "\u201cChurch?\u201d answered I, \u201cthat is a kind of state, and indeed the most\nmendacious. But remain quiet, thou dissembling dog! Thou surely knowest\nthine own species best!\n\nLike thyself the state is a dissembling dog; like thee doth it like\nto speak with smoke and roaring\u2014to make believe, like thee, that it\nspeaketh out of the heart of things.\n\nFor it seeketh by all means to be the most important creature on earth,\nthe state; and people think it so.\u201d", "When I had said this, the fire-dog acted as if mad with envy. \u201cWhat!\u201d\n cried he, \u201cthe most important creature on earth? And people think it\nso?\u201d And so much vapour and terrible voices came out of his throat, that\nI thought he would choke with vexation and envy.\n\nAt last he became calmer and his panting subsided; as soon, however, as\nhe was quiet, I said laughingly:\n\n\u201cThou art angry, fire-dog: so I am in the right about thee!", "And that I may also maintain the right, hear the story of another\nfire-dog; he speaketh actually out of the heart of the earth.\n\nGold doth his breath exhale, and golden rain: so doth his heart desire.\nWhat are ashes and smoke and hot dregs to him!\n\nLaughter flitteth from him like a variegated cloud; adverse is he to thy\ngargling and spewing and grips in the bowels!", "The gold, however, and the laughter\u2014these doth he take out of the heart\nof the earth: for, that thou mayst know it,\u2014THE HEART OF THE EARTH IS\nOF GOLD.\u201d\n\nWhen the fire-dog heard this, he could no longer endure to listen to me.\nAbashed did he draw in his tail, said \u201cbow-wow!\u201d in a cowed voice, and\ncrept down into his cave.\u2014\n\nThus told Zarathustra. His disciples, however, hardly listened to him:\nso great was their eagerness to tell him about the sailors, the rabbits,\nand the flying man.", "\u201cWhat am I to think of it!\u201d said Zarathustra. \u201cAm I indeed a ghost?\n\nBut it may have been my shadow. Ye have surely heard something of the\nWanderer and his Shadow?\n\nOne thing, however, is certain: I must keep a tighter hold of it;\notherwise it will spoil my reputation.\u201d\n\nAnd once more Zarathustra shook his head and wondered. \u201cWhat am I to\nthink of it!\u201d said he once more.\n\n\u201cWhy did the ghost cry: \u2018It is time! It is the highest time!\u2019\n\n_For what_ is it then\u2014the highest time?\u201d\u2014", "_For what_ is it then\u2014the highest time?\u201d\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nXLI. THE SOOTHSAYER.\n\n\n\u201c\u2014And I saw a great sadness come over mankind. The best turned weary of\ntheir works.\n\nA doctrine appeared, a faith ran beside it: \u2018All is empty, all is alike,\nall hath been!\u2019\n\nAnd from all hills there re-echoed: \u2018All is empty, all is alike, all\nhath been!\u2019\n\nTo be sure we have harvested: but why have all our fruits become rotten\nand brown? What was it fell last night from the evil moon?", "In vain was all our labour, poison hath our wine become, the evil eye\nhath singed yellow our fields and hearts.\n\nArid have we all become; and fire falling upon us, then do we turn dust\nlike ashes:\u2014yea, the fire itself have we made aweary.\n\nAll our fountains have dried up, even the sea hath receded. All the\nground trieth to gape, but the depth will not swallow!\n\n\u2018Alas! where is there still a sea in which one could be drowned?\u2019 so\nsoundeth our plaint\u2014across shallow swamps.", "Verily, even for dying have we become too weary; now do we keep awake\nand live on\u2014in sepulchres.\u201d\n\nThus did Zarathustra hear a soothsayer speak; and the foreboding touched\nhis heart and transformed him. Sorrowfully did he go about and wearily;\nand he became like unto those of whom the soothsayer had spoken.\u2014\n\nVerily, said he unto his disciples, a little while, and there cometh the\nlong twilight. Alas, how shall I preserve my light through it!", "That it may not smother in this sorrowfulness! To remoter worlds shall\nit be a light, and also to remotest nights!\n\nThus did Zarathustra go about grieved in his heart, and for three days\nhe did not take any meat or drink: he had no rest, and lost his speech.\nAt last it came to pass that he fell into a deep sleep. His disciples,\nhowever, sat around him in long night-watches, and waited anxiously to\nsee if he would awake, and speak again, and recover from his affliction.", "And this is the discourse that Zarathustra spake when he awoke; his\nvoice, however, came unto his disciples as from afar:\n\nHear, I pray you, the dream that I dreamed, my friends, and help me to\ndivine its meaning!\n\nA riddle is it still unto me, this dream; the meaning is hidden in it\nand encaged, and doth not yet fly above it on free pinions.\n\nAll life had I renounced, so I dreamed. Night-watchman and\ngrave-guardian had I become, aloft, in the lone mountain-fortress of\nDeath.", "There did I guard his coffins: full stood the musty vaults of those\ntrophies of victory. Out of glass coffins did vanquished life gaze upon\nme.\n\nThe odour of dust-covered eternities did I breathe: sultry and\ndust-covered lay my soul. And who could have aired his soul there!\n\nBrightness of midnight was ever around me; lonesomeness cowered beside\nher; and as a third, death-rattle stillness, the worst of my female\nfriends.", "Keys did I carry, the rustiest of all keys; and I knew how to open with\nthem the most creaking of all gates.\n\nLike a bitterly angry croaking ran the sound through the long corridors\nwhen the leaves of the gate opened: ungraciously did this bird cry,\nunwillingly was it awakened.\n\nBut more frightful even, and more heart-strangling was it, when it again\nbecame silent and still all around, and I alone sat in that malignant\nsilence.", "Thus did time pass with me, and slip by, if time there still was: what\ndo I know thereof! But at last there happened that which awoke me.\n\nThrice did there peal peals at the gate like thunders, thrice did the\nvaults resound and howl again: then did I go to the gate.\n\nAlpa! cried I, who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain?

And I cried with\nhorror as I ne\u2019er cried before.", "But mine own crying awoke me:\u2014and I came to myself.\u2014\n\nThus did Zarathustra relate his dream, and then was silent: for as yet\nhe knew not the interpretation thereof. But the disciple whom he loved\nmost arose quickly, seized Zarathustra\u2019s hand, and said:\n\n\u201cThy life itself interpreteth unto us this dream, O Zarathustra!\n\nArt thou not thyself the wind with shrill whistling, which bursteth open\nthe gates of the fortress of Death?", "Art thou not thyself the coffin full of many-hued malices and\nangel-caricatures of life?\n\nVerily, like a thousand peals of children\u2019s laughter cometh\nZarathustra into all sepulchres, laughing at those night-watchmen and\ngrave-guardians, and whoever else rattleth with sinister keys.\n\nWith thy laughter wilt thou frighten and prostrate them: fainting and\nrecovering will demonstrate thy power over them.", "And when the long twilight cometh and the mortal weariness, even then\nwilt thou not disappear from our firmament, thou advocate of life!\n\nNew stars hast thou made us see, and new nocturnal glories: verily,\nlaughter itself hast thou spread out over us like a many-hued canopy.\n\nNow will children\u2019s laughter ever from coffins flow; now will a strong\nwind ever come victoriously unto all mortal weariness: of this thou art\nthyself the pledge and the prophet!", "Verily, THEY THEMSELVES DIDST THOU DREAM, thine enemies: that was thy\nsorest dream.\n\nBut as thou awokest from them and camest to thyself, so shall they\nawaken from themselves\u2014and come unto thee!\u201d", "Thus spake the disciple; and all the others then thronged around\nZarathustra, grasped him by the hands, and tried to persuade him to\nleave his bed and his sadness, and return unto them. Zarathustra,\nhowever, sat upright on his couch, with an absent look. Like one\nreturning from long foreign sojourn did he look on his disciples, and\nexamined their features; but still he knew them not. When, however, they\nraised him, and set him upon his feet, behold, all on a sudden his eye", "changed; he understood everything that had happened, stroked his beard,\nand said with a strong voice:", "\u201cWell! this hath just its time; but see to it, my disciples, that we\nhave a good repast; and without delay!

Then did he gaze long into the face of the\ndisciple who had been the dream-interpreter, and shook his head.\u2014\n\n\n\n\nXLII. REDEMPTION.", "XLII. REDEMPTION.\n\n\nWhen Zarathustra went one day over the great bridge, then did the\ncripples and beggars surround him, and a hunchback spake thus unto him:", "\u201cBehold, Zarathustra! Even the people learn from thee, and acquire faith\nin thy teaching: but for them to believe fully in thee, one thing is\nstill needful\u2014thou must first of all convince us cripples! Here hast\nthou now a fine selection, and verily, an opportunity with more than one\nforelock! The blind canst thou heal, and make the lame run; and from\nhim who hath too much behind, couldst thou well, also, take away a\nlittle;\u2014that, I think, would be the right method to make the cripples", "believe in Zarathustra!\u201d", "Zarathustra, however, answered thus unto him who so spake: When one\ntaketh his hump from the hunchback, then doth one take from him his\nspirit\u2014so do the people teach. And when one giveth the blind man eyes,\nthen doth he see too many bad things on the earth: so that he curseth\nhim who healed him. He, however, who maketh the lame man run, inflicteth\nupon him the greatest injury; for hardly can he run, when his vices\nrun away with him\u2014so do the people teach concerning cripples. And why", "should not Zarathustra also learn from the people, when the people learn\nfrom Zarathustra?", "It is, however, the smallest thing unto me since I have been amongst\nmen, to see one person lacking an eye, another an ear, and a third a\nleg, and that others have lost the tongue, or the nose, or the head.", "I see and have seen worse things, and divers things so hideous, that I\nshould neither like to speak of all matters, nor even keep silent about\nsome of them: namely, men who lack everything, except that they have\ntoo much of one thing\u2014men who are nothing more than a big eye, or a big\nmouth, or a big belly, or something else big,\u2014reversed cripples, I call\nsuch men.", "And when I came out of my solitude, and for the first time passed over\nthis bridge, then I could not trust mine eyes, but looked again and\nagain, and said at last: \u201cThat is an ear! An ear as big as a man!\u201d I\nlooked still more attentively\u2014and actually there did move under the ear\nsomething that was pitiably small and poor and slim. And in truth this\nimmense ear was perched on a small thin stalk\u2014the stalk, however, was a\nman! A person putting a glass to his eyes, could even recognise further", "a small envious countenance, and also that a bloated soullet dangled at\nthe stalk. The people told me, however, that the big ear was not only a\nman, but a great man, a genius. But I never believed in the people when\nthey spake of great men\u2014and I hold to my belief that it was a reversed\ncripple, who had too little of everything, and too much of one thing.", "When Zarathustra had spoken thus unto the hunchback, and unto those of\nwhom the hunchback was the mouthpiece and advocate, then did he turn to\nhis disciples in profound dejection, and said:\n\nVerily, my friends, I walk amongst men as amongst the fragments and\nlimbs of human beings!\n\nThis is the terrible thing to mine eye, that I find man broken up, and\nscattered about, as on a battle- and butcher-ground.", "And when mine eye fleeth from the present to the bygone, it findeth ever\nthe same: fragments and limbs and fearful chances\u2014but no men!\n\nThe present and the bygone upon earth\u2014ah! my friends\u2014that is MY most\nunbearable trouble; and I should not know how to live, if I were not a\nseer of what is to come.\n\nA seer, a purposer, a creator, a future itself, and a bridge to the\nfuture\u2014and alas! also as it were a cripple on this bridge: all that is\nZarathustra.", "And ye also asked yourselves often: \u201cWho is Zarathustra to us?

Is this true? Conceal thyself not behind thy defiance!\u201d\u2014", "And I wept and trembled like a child, and said: \u201cAh, I would indeed, but\nhow can I do it! Exempt me only from this! It is beyond my power!\u201d\n\nThen was there again spoken unto me without voice: \u201cWhat matter about\nthyself, Zarathustra! Speak thy word, and succumb!\u201d\n\nAnd I answered: \u201cAh, is it MY word? Who am _I_? I await the worthier\none; I am not worthy even to succumb by it.\u201d", "Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: \u201cWhat matter about\nthyself? Thou art not yet humble enough for me. Humility hath the\nhardest skin.\u201d\u2014\n\nAnd I answered: \u201cWhat hath not the skin of my humility endured! At the\nfoot of my height do I dwell: how high are my summits, no one hath yet\ntold me. But well do I know my valleys.\u201d\n\nThen was there again spoken unto me without voice: \u201cO Zarathustra, he\nwho hath to remove mountains removeth also valleys and plains.\u201d\u2014", "And I answered: \u201cAs yet hath my word not removed mountains, and what I\nhave spoken hath not reached man.

At last, however, did I say\nwhat I had said at first. \u201cI will not.\u201d\n\nThen did a laughing take place all around me.

To you must I now GO DOWN!\n\nBefore my highest mountain do I stand, and before my longest wandering:\ntherefore must I first go deeper down than I ever ascended:\n\n\u2014Deeper down into pain than I ever ascended, even into its darkest\nflood! So willeth my fate. Well! I am ready.\n\nWhence come the highest mountains? so did I once ask. Then did I learn\nthat they come out of the sea.", "That testimony is inscribed on their stones, and on the walls of their\nsummits. Out of the deepest must the highest come to its height.\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra on the ridge of the mountain where it was cold:\nwhen, however, he came into the vicinity of the sea, and at last stood\nalone amongst the cliffs, then had he become weary on his way, and\neagerer than ever before.\n\nEverything as yet sleepeth, said he; even the sea sleepeth. Drowsily and\nstrangely doth its eye gaze upon me.", "But it breatheth warmly\u2014I feel it. And I feel also that it dreameth. It\ntosseth about dreamily on hard pillows.\n\nHark! Hark! How it groaneth with evil recollections! Or evil\nexpectations?\n\nAh, I am sad along with thee, thou dusky monster, and angry with myself\neven for thy sake.\n\nAh, that my hand hath not strength enough! Gladly, indeed, would I free\nthee from evil dreams!\u2014", "And while Zarathustra thus spake, he laughed at himself with melancholy\nand bitterness. What! Zarathustra, said he, wilt thou even sing\nconsolation to the sea?\n\nAh, thou amiable fool, Zarathustra, thou too-blindly confiding one! But\nthus hast thou ever been: ever hast thou approached confidently all that\nis terrible.\n\nEvery monster wouldst thou caress. A whiff of warm breath, a little soft\ntuft on its paw\u2014: and immediately wert thou ready to love and lure it.", "LOVE is the danger of the lonesomest one, love to anything, IF IT ONLY\nLIVE! Laughable, verily, is my folly and my modesty in love!\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra, and laughed thereby a second time. Then,\nhowever, he thought of his abandoned friends\u2014and as if he had done them\na wrong with his thoughts, he upbraided himself because of his thoughts.\nAnd forthwith it came to pass that the laugher wept\u2014with anger and\nlonging wept Zarathustra bitterly.\n\n\n\n\nXLVI. THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA.\n\n\n1.", "When it got abroad among the sailors that Zarathustra was on board the\nship\u2014for a man who came from the Happy Isles had gone on board along\nwith him,\u2014there was great curiosity and expectation. But Zarathustra\nkept silent for two days, and was cold and deaf with sadness; so that he\nneither answered looks nor questions. On the evening of the second day,\nhowever, he again opened his ears, though he still kept silent: for\nthere were many curious and dangerous things to be heard on board the", "ship, which came from afar, and was to go still further. Zarathustra,\nhowever, was fond of all those who make distant voyages, and dislike to\nlive without danger. And behold! when listening, his own tongue was\nat last loosened, and the ice of his heart broke. Then did he begin to\nspeak thus:", "To you, the daring venturers and adventurers, and whoever hath embarked\nwith cunning sails upon frightful seas,\u2014\n\nTo you the enigma-intoxicated, the twilight-enjoyers, whose souls are\nallured by flutes to every treacherous gulf:\n\n\u2014For ye dislike to grope at a thread with cowardly hand; and where ye\ncan DIVINE, there do ye hate to CALCULATE\u2014\n\nTo you only do I tell the enigma that I SAW\u2014the vision of the\nlonesomest one.\u2014", "Gloomily walked I lately in corpse-coloured twilight\u2014gloomily and\nsternly, with compressed lips. Not only one sun had set for me.\n\nA path which ascended daringly among boulders, an evil, lonesome path,\nwhich neither herb nor shrub any longer cheered, a mountain-path,\ncrunched under the daring of my foot.\n\nMutely marching over the scornful clinking of pebbles, trampling the\nstone that let it slip: thus did my foot force its way upwards.", "Upwards:\u2014in spite of the spirit that drew it downwards, towards the\nabyss, the spirit of gravity, my devil and arch-enemy.\n\nUpwards:\u2014although it sat upon me, half-dwarf, half-mole; paralysed,\nparalysing; dripping lead in mine ear, and thoughts like drops of lead\ninto my brain.\n\n\u201cO Zarathustra,\u201d it whispered scornfully, syllable by syllable, \u201cthou\nstone of wisdom! Thou threwest thyself high, but every thrown stone\nmust\u2014fall!", "O Zarathustra, thou stone of wisdom, thou sling-stone, thou\nstar-destroyer! Thyself threwest thou so high,\u2014but every thrown\nstone\u2014must fall!\n\nCondemned of thyself, and to thine own stoning: O Zarathustra, far\nindeed threwest thou thy stone\u2014but upon THYSELF will it recoil!\u201d\n\nThen was the dwarf silent; and it lasted long.

A sick one did I resemble, whom bad torture wearieth, and a worse\ndream reawakeneth out of his first sleep.\u2014\n\nBut there is something in me which I call courage: it hath hitherto\nslain for me every dejection. This courage at last bade me stand still\nand say: \u201cDwarf! Thou!

Is not seeing itself\u2014seeing abysses?\n\nCourage is the best slayer: courage slayeth also fellow-suffering.\nFellow-suffering, however, is the deepest abyss: as deeply as man\nlooketh into life, so deeply also doth he look into suffering.", "Courage, however, is the best slayer, courage which attacketh: it\nslayeth even death itself; for it saith: \u201cWAS THAT life?

Then there cried out of me: \u201cBite! Bite!\n\nIts head off! Bite!\u201d\u2014so cried it out of me; my horror, my hatred, my\nloathing, my pity, all my good and my bad cried with one voice out of\nme.\u2014", "Ye daring ones around me!

WHO is\nthe man into whose throat all the heaviest and blackest will thus crawl?\n\n\u2014The shepherd however bit as my cry had admonished him; he bit with a\nstrong bite!

Two kings do I see\u2014and only one ass!\u201d", "Thereupon the two kings made a halt; they smiled and looked towards the\nspot whence the voice proceeded, and afterwards looked into each other\u2019s\nfaces. \u201cSuch things do we also think among ourselves,\u201d said the king on\nthe right, \u201cbut we do not utter them.\u201d\n\nThe king on the left, however, shrugged his shoulders and answered:\n\u201cThat may perhaps be a goat-herd. Or an anchorite who hath lived too\nlong among rocks and trees. For no society at all spoileth also good\nmanners.\u201d", "\u201cGood manners?\u201d replied angrily and bitterly the other king: \u201cwhat\nthen do we run out of the way of? Is it not \u2018good manners\u2019?

But it is the kingdom of the populace\u2014I no longer allow\nanything to be imposed upon me. The populace, however\u2014that meaneth,\nhodgepodge.\n\nPopulace-hodgepodge: therein is everything mixed with everything, saint\nand swindler, gentleman and Jew, and every beast out of Noah\u2019s ark.", "Good manners! Everything is false and foul with us. No one knoweth any\nlonger how to reverence: it is THAT precisely that we run away from.\nThey are fulsome obtrusive dogs; they gild palm-leaves.\n\nThis loathing choketh me, that we kings ourselves have become false,\ndraped and disguised with the old faded pomp of our ancestors,\nshow-pieces for the stupidest, the craftiest, and whosoever at present\ntrafficketh for power.", "We ARE NOT the first men\u2014and have nevertheless to STAND FOR them: of\nthis imposture have we at last become weary and disgusted.\n\nFrom the rabble have we gone out of the way, from all those bawlers and\nscribe-blowflies, from the trader-stench, the ambition-fidgeting, the\nbad breath\u2014: fie, to live among the rabble;\n\n\u2014Fie, to stand for the first men among the rabble! Ah, loathing!\nLoathing! Loathing! What doth it now matter about us kings!\u201d\u2014", "\u201cThine old sickness seizeth thee,\u201d said here the king on the left, \u201cthy\nloathing seizeth thee, my poor brother. Thou knowest, however, that some\none heareth us.\u201d\n\nImmediately thereupon, Zarathustra, who had opened ears and eyes to this\ntalk, rose from his hiding-place, advanced towards the kings, and thus\nbegan:\n\n\u201cHe who hearkeneth unto you, he who gladly hearkeneth unto you, is\ncalled Zarathustra.", "I am Zarathustra who once said: \u2018What doth it now matter about kings!\u2019\nForgive me; I rejoiced when ye said to each other: \u2018What doth it matter\nabout us kings!\u2019\n\nHere, however, is MY domain and jurisdiction: what may ye be seeking in\nmy domain? Perhaps, however, ye have FOUND on your way what _I_ seek:\nnamely, the higher man.\u201d\n\nWhen the kings heard this, they beat upon their breasts and said with\none voice: \u201cWe are recognised!", "With the sword of thine utterance severest thou the thickest darkness of\nour hearts. Thou hast discovered our distress; for lo! we are on our way\nto find the higher man\u2014\n\n\u2014The man that is higher than we, although we are kings. To him do we\nconvey this ass. For the highest man shall also be the highest lord on\nearth.\n\nThere is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny, than when the mighty\nof the earth are not also the first men. Then everything becometh false\nand distorted and monstrous.", "And when they are even the last men, and more beast than man, then\nriseth and riseth the populace in honour, and at last saith even the\npopulace-virtue: \u2018Lo, I alone am virtue!\u2019\u201d\u2014\n\nWhat have I just heard? answered Zarathustra. What wisdom in kings! I\nam enchanted, and verily, I have already promptings to make a rhyme\nthereon:\u2014\n\n\u2014Even if it should happen to be a rhyme not suited for every one\u2019s\nears.

Then did we say at last: What doth it matter how\nhe look!", "We must HEAR him; him who teacheth: \u2018Ye shall love peace as a means to\nnew wars, and the short peace more than the long!\u2019\n\nNo one ever spake such warlike words: \u2018What is good? To be brave is\ngood.

Like those they thirsted for war. For a\nsword thirsteth to drink blood, and sparkleth with desire.\u201d\u2014", "\u2014When the kings thus discoursed and talked eagerly of the happiness of\ntheir fathers, there came upon Zarathustra no little desire to mock at\ntheir eagerness: for evidently they were very peaceable kings whom he\nsaw before him, kings with old and refined features. But he restrained\nhimself. \u201cWell!\u201d said he, \u201cthither leadeth the way, there lieth the\ncave of Zarathustra; and this day is to have a long evening!

What of that! Where doth one at present learn better to wait\nthan at courts?

To prick a swollen one in the belly, I call good\npastime. Hear that, ye boys!\n\nOur to-day is of the populace: who still KNOWETH what is great and what\nis small! Who could there seek successfully for greatness! A fool only:\nit succeedeth with fools.\n\nThou seekest for great men, thou strange fool? Who TAUGHT that to thee?\nIs to-day the time for it? Oh, thou bad seeker, why dost thou\u2014tempt\nme?\u201d\u2014", "Thus spake Zarathustra, comforted in his heart, and went laughing on his\nway.\n\n\n\n\nLXVI. OUT OF SERVICE.\n\n\nNot long, however, after Zarathustra had freed himself from the\nmagician, he again saw a person sitting beside the path which he\nfollowed, namely a tall, black man, with a haggard, pale countenance:\nTHIS MAN grieved him exceedingly. \u201cAlas,\u201d said he to his heart, \u201cthere\nsitteth disguised affliction; methinketh he is of the type of the\npriests: what do THEY want in my domain?", "What! Hardly have I escaped from that magician, and must another\nnecromancer again run across my path,\u2014\n\n\u2014Some sorcerer with laying-on-of-hands, some sombre wonder-worker by\nthe grace of God, some anointed world-maligner, whom, may the devil\ntake!\n\nBut the devil is never at the place which would be his right place: he\nalways cometh too late, that cursed dwarf and club-foot!\u201d\u2014", "Thus cursed Zarathustra impatiently in his heart, and considered how\nwith averted look he might slip past the black man. But behold, it came\nabout otherwise. For at the same moment had the sitting one already\nperceived him; and not unlike one whom an unexpected happiness\novertaketh, he sprang to his feet, and went straight towards\nZarathustra.\n\n\u201cWhoever thou art, thou traveller,\u201d said he, \u201chelp a strayed one, a\nseeker, an old man, who may here easily come to grief!", "The world here is strange to me, and remote; wild beasts also did I hear\nhowling; and he who could have given me protection\u2014he is himself no\nmore.\n\nI was seeking the pious man, a saint and an anchorite, who, alone in his\nforest, had not yet heard of what all the world knoweth at present.\u201d\n\n\u201cWHAT doth all the world know at present?\u201d asked Zarathustra. \u201cPerhaps\nthat the old God no longer liveth, in whom all the world once believed?\u201d", "\u201cThou sayest it,\u201d answered the old man sorrowfully. \u201cAnd I served that\nold God until his last hour.\n\nNow, however, am I out of service, without master, and yet not free;\nlikewise am I no longer merry even for an hour, except it be in\nrecollections.\n\nTherefore did I ascend into these mountains, that I might finally have\na festival for myself once more, as becometh an old pope and\nchurch-father: for know it, that I am the last pope!\u2014a festival of\npious recollections and divine services.", "Now, however, is he himself dead, the most pious of men, the saint in\nthe forest, who praised his God constantly with singing and mumbling.\n\nHe himself found I no longer when I found his cot\u2014but two wolves found\nI therein, which howled on account of his death,\u2014for all animals loved\nhim. Then did I haste away.", "Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains? Then did my\nheart determine that I should seek another, the most pious of all\nthose who believe not in God\u2014, my heart determined that I should seek\nZarathustra!\u201d\n\nThus spake the hoary man, and gazed with keen eyes at him who stood\nbefore him. Zarathustra however seized the hand of the old pope and\nregarded it a long while with admiration.", "\u201cLo! thou venerable one,\u201d said he then, \u201cwhat a fine and long hand! That\nis the hand of one who hath ever dispensed blessings. Now, however, doth\nit hold fast him whom thou seekest, me, Zarathustra.\n\nIt is I, the ungodly Zarathustra, who saith: \u2018Who is ungodlier than I,\nthat I may enjoy his teaching?\u2019\u201d\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra, and penetrated with his glances the thoughts and\narrear-thoughts of the old pope. At last the latter began:", "\u201cHe who most loved and possessed him hath now also lost him most\u2014:\n\n\u2014Lo, I myself am surely the most godless of us at present? But who\ncould rejoice at that!\u201d\u2014\n\n\u2014\u201cThou servedst him to the last?\u201d asked Zarathustra thoughtfully, after\na deep silence, \u201cthou knowest HOW he died? Is it true what they say,\nthat sympathy choked him;\n\n\u2014That he saw how MAN hung on the cross, and could not endure it;\u2014that\nhis love to man became his hell, and at last his death?\u201d\u2014", "The old pope however did not answer, but looked aside timidly, with a\npainful and gloomy expression.\n\n\u201cLet him go,\u201d said Zarathustra, after prolonged meditation, still\nlooking the old man straight in the eye.\n\n\u201cLet him go, he is gone. And though it honoureth thee that thou speakest\nonly in praise of this dead one, yet thou knowest as well as I WHO he\nwas, and that he went curious ways.\u201d", "\u201cTo speak before three eyes,\u201d said the old pope cheerfully (he was blind\nof one eye), \u201cin divine matters I am more enlightened than Zarathustra\nhimself\u2014and may well be so.\n\nMy love served him long years, my will followed all his will. A good\nservant, however, knoweth everything, and many a thing even which a\nmaster hideth from himself.\n\nHe was a hidden God, full of secrecy. Verily, he did not come by his\nson otherwise than by secret ways. At the door of his faith standeth\nadultery.", "Whoever extolleth him as a God of love, doth not think highly enough of\nlove itself. Did not that God want also to be judge? But the loving one\nloveth irrespective of reward and requital.\n\nWhen he was young, that God out of the Orient, then was he harsh and\nrevengeful, and built himself a hell for the delight of his favourites.\n\nAt last, however, he became old and soft and mellow and pitiful,\nmore like a grandfather than a father, but most like a tottering old\ngrandmother.", "There did he sit shrivelled in his chimney-corner, fretting on account\nof his weak legs, world-weary, will-weary, and one day he suffocated of\nhis all-too-great pity.\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cThou old pope,\u201d said here Zarathustra interposing, \u201chast thou seen THAT\nwith thine eyes? It could well have happened in that way: in that way,\nAND also otherwise. When Gods die they always die many kinds of death.", "Well! At all events, one way or other\u2014he is gone! He was counter to the\ntaste of mine ears and eyes; worse than that I should not like to say\nagainst him.\n\nI love everything that looketh bright and speaketh honestly. But\nhe\u2014thou knowest it, forsooth, thou old priest, there was something of\nthy type in him, the priest-type\u2014he was equivocal.\n\nHe was also indistinct. How he raged at us, this wrath-snorter, because\nwe understood him badly! But why did he not speak more clearly?", "And if the fault lay in our ears, why did he give us ears that heard him\nbadly? If there was dirt in our ears, well! who put it in them?\n\nToo much miscarried with him, this potter who had not learned\nthoroughly! That he took revenge on his pots and creations, however,\nbecause they turned out badly\u2014that was a sin against GOOD TASTE.", "There is also good taste in piety: THIS at last said: \u2018Away with SUCH\na God! Better to have no God, better to set up destiny on one\u2019s own\naccount, better to be a fool, better to be God oneself!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014\u201cWhat do I hear!\u201d said then the old pope, with intent ears; \u201cO\nZarathustra, thou art more pious than thou believest, with such an\nunbelief! Some God in thee hath converted thee to thine ungodliness.", "Is it not thy piety itself which no longer letteth thee believe in a\nGod? And thine over-great honesty will yet lead thee even beyond good\nand evil!\n\nBehold, what hath been reserved for thee? Thou hast eyes and hands and\nmouth, which have been predestined for blessing from eternity. One doth\nnot bless with the hand alone.\n\nNigh unto thee, though thou professest to be the ungodliest one, I feel\na hale and holy odour of long benedictions: I feel glad and grieved\nthereby.", "Let me be thy guest, O Zarathustra, for a single night! Nowhere on earth\nshall I now feel better than with thee!\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cAmen! So shall it be!\u201d said Zarathustra, with great astonishment; \u201cup\nthither leadeth the way, there lieth the cave of Zarathustra.\n\nGladly, forsooth, would I conduct thee thither myself, thou venerable\none; for I love all pious men. But now a cry of distress calleth me\nhastily away from thee.", "In my domain shall no one come to grief; my cave is a good haven. And\nbest of all would I like to put every sorrowful one again on firm land\nand firm legs.\n\nWho, however, could take THY melancholy off thy shoulders? For that I am\ntoo weak. Long, verily, should we have to wait until some one re-awoke\nthy God for thee.\n\nFor that old God liveth no more: he is indeed dead.\u201d\u2014\n\nThus spake Zarathustra.\n\n\n\n\nLXVII. THE UGLIEST MAN.", "LXVII. THE UGLIEST MAN.\n\n\n\u2014And again did Zarathustra\u2019s feet run through mountains and forests,\nand his eyes sought and sought, but nowhere was he to be seen whom they\nwanted to see\u2014the sorely distressed sufferer and crier. On the whole\nway, however, he rejoiced in his heart and was full of gratitude. \u201cWhat\ngood things,\u201d said he, \u201chath this day given me, as amends for its bad\nbeginning! What strange interlocutors have I found!", "At their words will I now chew a long while as at good corn; small\nshall my teeth grind and crush them, until they flow like milk into my\nsoul!\u201d\u2014", "When, however, the path again curved round a rock, all at once the\nlandscape changed, and Zarathustra entered into a realm of death. Here\nbristled aloft black and red cliffs, without any grass, tree, or bird\u2019s\nvoice. For it was a valley which all animals avoided, even the beasts of\nprey, except that a species of ugly, thick, green serpent came here to\ndie when they became old. Therefore the shepherds called this valley:\n\u201cSerpent-death.\u201d", "Zarathustra, however, became absorbed in dark recollections, for it\nseemed to him as if he had once before stood in this valley. And much\nheaviness settled on his mind, so that he walked slowly and always more\nslowly, and at last stood still. Then, however, when he opened his eyes,\nhe saw something sitting by the wayside shaped like a man, and hardly\nlike a man, something nondescript. And all at once there came over\nZarathustra a great shame, because he had gazed on such a thing.", "Blushing up to the very roots of his white hair, he turned aside his\nglance, and raised his foot that he might leave this ill-starred place.\nThen, however, became the dead wilderness vocal: for from the ground a\nnoise welled up, gurgling and rattling, as water gurgleth and rattleth\nat night through stopped-up water-pipes; and at last it turned into\nhuman voice and human speech:\u2014it sounded thus:", "\u201cZarathustra! Zarathustra! Read my riddle! Say, say! WHAT IS THE REVENGE\nON THE WITNESS?\n\nI entice thee back; here is smooth ice!

Say then: who am\n_I_!\u201d", "\u2014When however Zarathustra had heard these words,\u2014what think ye then\ntook place in his soul? PITY OVERCAME HIM; and he sank down all at\nonce, like an oak that hath long withstood many tree-fellers,\u2014heavily,\nsuddenly, to the terror even of those who meant to fell it. But\nimmediately he got up again from the ground, and his countenance became\nstern.\n\n\u201cI know thee well,\u201d said he, with a brazen voice, \u201cTHOU ART THE MURDERER\nOF GOD! Let me go.", "Thou couldst not ENDURE him who beheld THEE,\u2014who ever beheld thee\nthrough and through, thou ugliest man. Thou tookest revenge on this\nwitness!\u201d\n\nThus spake Zarathustra and was about to go; but the nondescript grasped\nat a corner of his garment and began anew to gurgle and seek for words.\n\u201cStay,\u201d said he at last\u2014\n\n\u2014\u201cStay! Do not pass by! I have divined what axe it was that struck thee\nto the ground: hail to thee, O Zarathustra, that thou art again upon thy\nfeet!", "Thou hast divined, I know it well, how the man feeleth who killed\nhim,\u2014the murderer of God.

O\nZarathustra, protect me, thou, my last refuge, thou sole one who\ndivinedst me:\n\n\u2014Thou hast divined how the man feeleth who killed HIM. Stay! And if\nthou wilt go, thou impatient one, go not the way that I came. THAT way\nis bad.", "Art thou angry with me because I have already racked language too long?\nBecause I have already counselled thee? But know that it is I, the\nugliest man,\n\n\u2014Who have also the largest, heaviest feet. Where _I_ have gone, the way\nis bad.

THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR.\n\n\nWhen Zarathustra had left the ugliest man, he was chilled and felt\nlonesome: for much coldness and lonesomeness came over his spirit, so\nthat even his limbs became colder thereby.

The kine,\nhowever, seemed to listen eagerly to a speaker, and took no heed of him\nwho approached. When, however, Zarathustra was quite nigh unto them,\nthen did he hear plainly that a human voice spake in the midst of the\nkine, and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the\nspeaker.", "Then ran Zarathustra up speedily and drove the animals aside; for he\nfeared that some one had here met with harm, which the pity of the\nkine would hardly be able to relieve. But in this he was deceived; for\nbehold, there sat a man on the ground who seemed to be persuading\nthe animals to have no fear of him, a peaceable man and\nPreacher-on-the-Mount, out of whose eyes kindness itself preached. \u201cWhat\ndost thou seek here?\u201d called out Zarathustra in astonishment.", "\u201cWhat do I here seek?\u201d answered he: \u201cthe same that thou seekest, thou\nmischief-maker; that is to say, happiness upon earth.\n\nTo that end, however, I would fain learn of these kine.

Why dost thou disturb them?\n\nExcept we be converted and become as kine, we shall in no wise enter\ninto the kingdom of heaven.

And\ntalk to mine animals of the happiness of animals,\u2014\n\n\u2014Until I myself come home. For now a cry of distress calleth me hastily\naway from thee.

THE SHADOW.", "LXIX. THE SHADOW.\n\n\nScarcely however was the voluntary beggar gone in haste, and Zarathustra\nagain alone, when he heard behind him a new voice which called out:\n\u201cStay! Zarathustra! Do wait! It is myself, forsooth, O Zarathustra,\nmyself, thy shadow!\u201d But Zarathustra did not wait; for a sudden\nirritation came over him on account of the crowd and the crowding in his\nmountains. \u201cWhither hath my lonesomeness gone?\u201d spake he.", "\u201cIt is verily becoming too much for me; these mountains swarm; my\nkingdom is no longer of THIS world; I require new mountains.\n\nMy shadow calleth me?

But the one behind\nfollowed after him, so that immediately there were three runners,\none after the other\u2014namely, foremost the voluntary beggar, then\nZarathustra, and thirdly, and hindmost, his shadow. But not long had\nthey run thus when Zarathustra became conscious of his folly, and shook\noff with one jerk all his irritation and detestation.\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d said he, \u201chave not the most ludicrous things always happened to\nus old anchorites and saints?", "Verily, my folly hath grown big in the mountains! Now do I hear six old\nfools\u2019 legs rattling behind one another!\n\nBut doth Zarathustra need to be frightened by his shadow? Also,\nmethinketh that after all it hath longer legs than mine.\u201d", "Thus spake Zarathustra, and, laughing with eyes and entrails, he stood\nstill and turned round quickly\u2014and behold, he almost thereby threw his\nshadow and follower to the ground, so closely had the latter followed at\nhis heels, and so weak was he. For when Zarathustra scrutinised him\nwith his glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition, so slender,\nswarthy, hollow and worn-out did this follower appear.", "\u201cWho art thou?\u201d asked Zarathustra vehemently, \u201cwhat doest thou here? And\nwhy callest thou thyself my shadow? Thou art not pleasing unto me.\u201d\n\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d answered the shadow, \u201cthat it is I; and if I please thee\nnot\u2014well, O Zarathustra! therein do I admire thee and thy good taste.", "A wanderer am I, who have walked long at thy heels; always on the way,\nbut without a goal, also without a home: so that verily, I lack little\nof being the eternally Wandering Jew, except that I am not eternal and\nnot a Jew.\n\nWhat?

NOONTIDE.", "\u2014And Zarathustra ran and ran, but he found no one else, and was alone\nand ever found himself again; he enjoyed and quaffed his solitude, and\nthought of good things\u2014for hours. About the hour of noontide, however,\nwhen the sun stood exactly over Zarathustra\u2019s head, he passed an old,\nbent and gnarled tree, which was encircled round by the ardent love of\na vine, and hidden from itself; from this there hung yellow grapes in\nabundance, confronting the wanderer. Then he felt inclined to quench a", "little thirst, and to break off for himself a cluster of grapes. When,\nhowever, he had already his arm outstretched for that purpose, he felt\nstill more inclined for something else\u2014namely, to lie down beside the\ntree at the hour of perfect noontide and sleep.", "This Zarathustra did; and no sooner had he laid himself on the ground in\nthe stillness and secrecy of the variegated grass, than he had forgotten\nhis little thirst, and fell asleep.

THE GREETING.", "It was late in the afternoon only when Zarathustra, after long useless\nsearching and strolling about, again came home to his cave. When,\nhowever, he stood over against it, not more than twenty paces therefrom,\nthe thing happened which he now least of all expected: he heard anew the\ngreat CRY OF DISTRESS. And extraordinary! this time the cry came out\nof his own cave. It was a long, manifold, peculiar cry, and Zarathustra\nplainly distinguished that it was composed of many voices: although", "heard at a distance it might sound like the cry out of a single mouth.", "Thereupon Zarathustra rushed forward to his cave, and behold! what a\nspectacle awaited him after that concert! For there did they all sit\ntogether whom he had passed during the day: the king on the right and\nthe king on the left, the old magician, the pope, the voluntary\nbeggar, the shadow, the intellectually conscientious one, the sorrowful\nsoothsayer, and the ass; the ugliest man, however, had set a crown on\nhis head, and had put round him two purple girdles,\u2014for he liked, like", "all ugly ones, to disguise himself and play the handsome person. In the\nmidst, however, of that sorrowful company stood Zarathustra\u2019s eagle,\nruffled and disquieted, for it had been called upon to answer too much\nfor which its pride had not any answer; the wise serpent however hung\nround its neck.", "All this did Zarathustra behold with great astonishment; then however he\nscrutinised each individual guest with courteous curiosity, read their\nsouls and wondered anew. In the meantime the assembled ones had risen\nfrom their seats, and waited with reverence for Zarathustra to speak.\nZarathustra however spake thus:", "\u201cYe despairing ones! Ye strange ones! So it was YOUR cry of distress\nthat I heard? And now do I know also where he is to be sought, whom I\nhave sought for in vain to-day: THE HIGHER MAN\u2014:\n\n\u2014In mine own cave sitteth he, the higher man! But why do I wonder!

Welcome here,\nwelcome to you, my guests!\u201d\n\nThus spake Zarathustra, and laughed with love and mischief. After this\ngreeting his guests bowed once more and were reverentially silent; the\nking on the right, however, answered him in their name.", "\u201cO Zarathustra, by the way in which thou hast given us thy hand and thy\ngreeting, we recognise thee as Zarathustra.
